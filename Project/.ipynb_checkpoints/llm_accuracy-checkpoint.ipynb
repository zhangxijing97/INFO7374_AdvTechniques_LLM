      "- MRI brain diffusion weighted images showed acute ischemic infarcts in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, superior vermis, and PCA distribution\n",
      "- CT angiogram of head and neck revealed focal loss of gray-white differentiation involving the left temporal, occipital lobe in a left PCA distribution, and a region in the left cerebellar hemisphere with no flow-limiting stenosis of the major arteries of the neck\n",
      "- This evidence strongly suggests occlusion of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and cerebellar branches leading to ischemic stroke\n",
      "\n",
      "Suitable Treatments:\n",
      "- Aspirin, Plavix, and high-intensity statin as prescribed\n",

      "* Urgency: Moderate\n",
      "* Rationale: The history of fever, pharyngeal pain, and throat pain for three days, coupled with the physical examination findings of a swollen and red pharynx without throat plaques, strongly suggests viral pharyngitis\n",
