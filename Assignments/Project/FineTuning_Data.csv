"A 64-year-old woman presented  with fever and weakness over the last few days. The patient was feeling agitated during the physical examination. She also complained of left back pain. Her medical history included poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. 

Patient was sent to ED for further evaluation in red code by 118 Ambulance

Laboratory results demonstrated that her white cell count was 27,700 cells per cubic millimeter (the normal range: 3,500 to 9,500). The C-reactive protein level was 32.873 mg per deciliter, the blood urea nitrogen level was 20.70 mmol per liter, and the creatinine level was 312.7 μmol per liter. Urinalysis showed an elevated leukocyte count and bacteriuria. 

A CT scan in horizontal plane sectioning showed that the left kidney was significantly enlarged with thickened perirenal fascia, which was related to the presence of gas in the renal parenchyma and the kidney pelvis (Figure 1). She was transferred to the intensive care (ICU)  and treated with meropenem and broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics.

On admission to the ICU (day 0), she was drowsy. Her vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.5 °C; pulse rate, 102 beats/min; respiratory rate, 28 breaths/min; blood pressure, 122/54 mmHg (noradrenaline 0.5 microg/kg per min); and pulse oxygen saturation, 98% with high flow oxygen therapy. Diminished breath sounds in her right lower lung were heard on auscultation. There was no audible cardiac murmur. Her abdomen was soft but she failed to cooperate with the abdominal tenderness examination, along with mild pitting edema of both lower limbs. The patient was diagnosed with emphysematous pyelonephritis and septic shock, possibly caused by a gas-producing uropathogenic infection. Unfortunately, according to the RIFLE criteria, the patient developed acute renal failure and was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy. However, after active treatment, the clinical effect was remarkable. Her clinical symptoms and serum inflammatory indicators improved gradually, and she stopped using norepinephrine (day 3). Her renal function (day 3) also recovered, and she was successfully weaned with continuous renal replacement therapy. On the third day, both blood and urine cultures reported extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli. The patients condition continued to improve, and she no longer needed to be treated in the ICU on the 6th day. The patients abdominal CT scan (day 12) revealed that the gas collection in the pelvis and calyces had disappeared. Finally, the patient was discharged.

RIFLE is an acronym of Risk, Injury, and Failure; and Loss; and End-stage kidney disease. See the table below. ESRD = end-stage renal disease; GFR = glomerular filtration rate; SCr = serum creatinine; UO = urine output; Note: Patients can be either classified by GFR criteria or by UO criteria. ","Diagnosis:

Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN)

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale: Correctly diagnosed by the engine

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g, meropenem), intensive care management, and possibly nephrectomy if the patients condition deteriorates
* Aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors (e.g, noradrenaline), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care in the ICU"
"Home call with ED settings 

She was pregnant, fever and flank pain, burning and pain with urination, frequent and urgent urination for 30 days. Recently in local hospital she was treated with large spectrum antibiotics due suspected kidney bacteriuria. The detailed therapeutics were unclear except that she had taken cephalosporin orally for 8 days. She claimed that the symptoms were not obviously relieved after such treatment. Physical examination indicated high fever of 39.5°C, pan-abdominal pain (tenderness and rebound tenderness), pain in the renal region, swelling of both the low extremities. Vaginal bleeding and exudate were not observed.

Vital signs: BP 140/97; HR118; SPO2 95%; BT 37.8C.

Physical signs: patient was alert but in pain, pale skin, and heavy sweating. She was not very cooperative. Called 118 in red code

Suspected diagnosis: UTI

118 ECG:

Tachycardia with T wave anomaly

 Blood routine examination on day 1 showed high WBC count, particularly neutrophils, and severe anemia. The detailed values ​​of the blood routine examination were shown in Table 1. Biochemical examination on day 1 showed an elevation of total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL) and low albumin level. The patient did not have acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The detailed values ​​of biochemical examination were shown in Table 2. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 198 mg/L, PCT was 3.65, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 153 mm/h. Urine routine examination showed the existence of WBC (3+). Coagulation routine examination results were shown in Table 3. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1) showed that the kidneys were slightly enlarged with abnormal signals in both kidneys and perirenal cavity along with thickening of renal fascia. Abdominal MRI also showed expansion of renal pelvis and the upper segment of ureters and the possibility of kidney or peri-renal abscess. In addition, peritonitis was also considered since there was signal enhancement of the major omentum and related fat space. Abdominal ultrasound on admission showed several small stones in the renal calices (the biggest one of 0.8×0.9 cm). Abdominal ultrasound also revealed hydro-nephrosis. Intravenous cefoperazone sodium sulbactam sodium was arranged every 8 hours to combat infection. Human serum albumin was used to supplement protein. Blood trans-fusion was prescribed to relieve anemia. To reduce the risk of resistant bacteria or even multiple-resistance bacteria, medical staff arranged urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity examinations.

However, on the morning of day 2, the patient manifested impaired consciousness and could not express herself clearly. Her blood pressure dropped to 81/52 mmHg and heart rate was 87 per minute. Considering the blood pressure, overall state, and laboratory test results, septic shock was diagnosed. She had a regular and normal heart rhythm and auscultations of the heart valves were normal. Immediate fluid infusion and symptomatic treatment were done along with deep vein catheterization to monitor central venous pressure (CVP). Antibiotics were changed to meropenem (1.0g ivgtt q8h). To prevent other unpredictable risks, the patient was transferred to ICU department for further treatment. Her blood pressure has not elevated to normal despite the fluid transfusion and antibiotic treatment. Given that the infection was not easily relieved by conventional antibiotics due to kidney stones and the fact that the patient had upper urinary tract obstruction shown by hydronephrosis, we decided to implant double-J ureteral stents to promote drainage in order to relieve inflammation. During the procedure, we found erythema and hyperemia at the tri-gone of bladder. Flow of urine from the ureteral orifices was observed. After the implantation of double-J ureteric stents, we observed outflow of turbid urine with white floccules. Urine culture result came out and showed the main type of bacteria was Escherichia coli with resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The detailed results of antibiotic sensitivity examination were shown in Table 4. According to antibiotic sensitivity examination, the bacteria were sensitive to meropenem. Thus, meropenem was used for a continuous 5 days. On day 5, ultrasound examination (Figure 3.) found several stones in the bladder and narrowing of the ureters, indicating that obstruction of the upper urinary tract due to kidney stones gradually relieved with the help of drainage by double-J ureteric stents. Starting from day 7, antibiotic therapy was changed to cefoperazone-sulbactam (2g ivgtt q8h) for another week. Starting from day 4, S-adenosyl-L-methionine was used to protect the liver. From day 8, the blood routine examination and biochemical examination results started to improve (Tables 1, 2). The patients blood pressure fluctuated between 120-130/85-95 mmHg and fetal heart rate fluctuated between 120–150 times/min. CRP also dropped to 4 mg/L. Antibiotics were suspended on day 13. On day 15, the patients blood pressure stabilized around 120/90 mmHg, and routine blood examination and biochemical examination results went back to normal. The patient was discharged on day","Diagnosis:

Septic shock secondary to pyelonephritis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale: Low Blood pressure and test findings associated with sepsis are suggestive of septic shock

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"A 63-year-old man, overweight, heavy smoker, social alcohol drinker
At home presented with a one-day history of shaking chills and high fever. He got wet in the rain 5 days before he came to the hospital, and had an occupational history of septic tank servicer. He had no underlying medical conditions, and denied travel to any areas of endemic. 
Physical examination revealed BP 80/50 mmHg, HR 105 bpm, SpO2 98% on oxygen mask air, and tachypnea with wet rales in both lungs, no conjunctival suffusion and no icteric sclera. 
Abdominal examination revealed a mild right abdomen tenderness and suspicious positive percussion pain in the kidney area. The rest of the examination, including nervous system, was also unremarkable.

"A 75-year-old man presents after routine bloodwork revealed a leukocytosis with an absolute lymphocytosis and without monocytopenia. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, coronary artery disease, asthma, and hypertension. He has no surgical history except for routine colonoscopies and a recent angiogram. His current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, glipizide, lisinopril, amlodipine, aspirin, rosuvastatin, bisoprolol, and a corticosteroid inhaler.
He has no history of smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. He has a family history of diabetes and hypertension. He has no family history of cancer. The patient is retired but is able to carry out all activities of daily living without difficulty.
Physical Examination and Workup
The patients initial vital signs are unremarkable. Physical examination findings include trace lower extremity edema as well as a 3/6 systolic murmur. No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy or organomegaly is noted. The patient reports that he is in his usual state of health.
Initial laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16,200/mm3 (reference range, 4500-11,000/mm3) and an absolute lymphocyte count of 9072/mm3 (reference range, 1000-4800/mm3). These laboratory abnormalities are monitored intermittently over the course of the next year without significant change. During this period, the patient remains asymptomatic and in relatively good health otherwise. However, he subsequently begins to develop fatigue in addition to left upper quadrant pain, which prompts further workup.
A peripheral blood smear shows atypical lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and hairlike projections. Flow cytometry examination reveals a clonal B-cell population that expresses bright CD11c, bright CD20, and lambda light chain but is negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, and CD25. A bone marrow biopsy is performed, and immunohistochemistry shows that the neoplastic cells are positive for CD20 and PAX5 (Figure 1A and 1B) and negative for CD5, CD10, cyclin D1, BCL-6, and CD123. Immunostaining for annexin-A1 is also negative. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow aspirate detects an abnormal cell population that is larger and more granular than lymphocytes and expresses bright CD11c in addition to CD19, CD20, CD45, CD103, CD123 (dimly in a minor subset), and monotypic lambda light chain (Figure 1D). The abnormal cell population is negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, and CD25.
Because of his worsening symptoms and lymphocytosis, in addition to marked splenomegaly revealed on imaging, the patient is treated with cladribine. Nine months later, he reports a recurrence of symptoms, and bloodwork shows persistent lymphocytosis. The patient is then treated with cladribine and rituximab and reports an improvement in symptoms. Laboratory values obtained 2 months after treatment show a WBC count of 6200/mm3.
Unfortunately, his disease progresses within several weeks, and bloodwork reveals a WBC count of 52,800/mm3 and an absolute lymphocyte count of 48,570/mm3. A peripheral blood smear shows small- to medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells with cytoplasmic projections (Figure 1C). Flow cytometric analysis of the peripheral blood confirms relapse; however, functional imaging, laboratory studies, and pathologic examination fail to demonstrate transformation into a high-grade cancer. Next-generation sequencing of the patients B cells unveils a MAP2K1 mutation but is negative for BRAF, IGHV, and downstream MEK/ERK mutations.
In addition to a recurrence of prior symptoms, the patient reports worsening vision along with impairments of right eye adduction and left eye abduction. MRI of the brain shows bilateral variable-sized foci of cerebral hemorrhaging of various ages involving both cerebral hemispheres, the cerebellum, and the brainstem (Figure 2). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected by lumbar puncture is negative for infectious agents but is positive for atypical hairy lymphoid cells in a background of red blood cells. ","Diagnosis:

" 76 year old, obese, non smoker (Territorial referral to ED with Red code) 
 
I was called by her son for home visit as she was not responding and severe dyspnea (2024).
 
Clinical history: Woman with multiple comorbidities underwent surgical implantation of intermediary total hip prosthesis of the left hip, in February 2020, after the basic cervical fracture of the upper femur extremity due to trauma. After an episode of dislocation of the prosthetic implant, in March 2024,  the patient started complaining of an ingravescent coxalgia on the left side, with functional limitation and the appearance of secretion through sinus on the previous surgical scar; since April , the patient developed a urinary tract infection, treated with a course of antibiotic at home.
 
Physical signs: unconscious, precoma breathing, since recently diagnosed of senile dementia, anxiety-depressive syndrome, lower extremities venous insufficiency, biliary lithiasis, spondylosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity and arterial hypertension.
 
Vital signs: BT 40.5 °C with chills, level of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, 11 points; BP, 90/50 mmHg; HR, 115 beats/min; RR, 28 breaths/min; and SpO2, 88%. Pupils were of the same size, no response contralateral light reflex was noted, and there was pharyngeal redness; tonsillar redness, swelling, with moss white color. The heart and respiratory sounds were shallow.
First diagnosis: sepsis was suspected due to possible site prosthesis infection.
 
I called 118 ambulance with red code.
Ambulance confirmed vital signs. ECG: prolonged QTc interval, Osborn waves, left bundle branch blocks, nonspecific ST changes. ABG analysis: SpO2, 82%, PaO2 240 mmHg (80–100 mmHg), FiO2 0.6 (0.22), PaO2/FiO2 120 (> 500).
 
Three days later, following the ED hospitalization  an infection from E. cloacae complex was discovered. The clinical picture featured coxalgia and secreting fistula in the surgical wound. 
 
CBC: White blood cell count 14,000/µL (4500–7500/µL), Neutrophils 95% (42–74%), Lymphocytes 4.5 (18–50%), Monocytes 8.0% (1–10%), Hemoglobin 6.6 g/dL ( 11.3–15.2 g/dL), Platelet count 38.7 × 104/µL (15.0–35.0 × 104/µL), C-reactive protein 22 mg/dL (0.00–0.30 mg/dL), Blood urea nitrogen 50 mg/dL ( 8.0–20.0 mg/dL), Creatinine 1.80 mg/dL (0.40–0.80 mg/dL), Total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL (0.2–1.2 mg/dL). Lactate levels 6.0 mmol/L, (cut off to 2 mmol/L).
 
 
Following a specific antibiotic therapy, carried out intravenously, condition deteriorated very quick and she died the same day.
Final diagnosis ARDS and sepsis due to E. Cloacae infection. ","Diagnosis:

Sepsis due to Prosthesis Infection

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The patient has a history of coxalgia and secreting fistula at the site of the hip prosthesis, which is a common route for bacterial entry and infection. The very high body temperature (40.5°C) and significantly elevated C-reactive protein (22 mg/dL) suggest a severe infection. The rapid deterioration and high white blood cell count further support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"

Home visit called by his mother (2024)

 

Clinical history: During end of  October 2023 during a camp training session he injured with a complex acetabular and hip joint fracture caused after parachuting landing. He was moved to local ED and immediately he went through surgery for the left hip joint; since two weeks he started to feel uneasy, with fever and pain in the groins.  

 

Physical signs: conscious and responsive, with fast shallow breathing, exhausted. The surgery site was red, swollen, and warm; pus discharged from a stitch.

 

Vital signs: BT 48.5 °C with chills, good level of consciousness; BP, 105/60 mmHg; HR, 115 beats/min; RR, 30 breaths/min; and SpO2, 90%. Pupils were of the same size,  response to contralateral light reflex was noted. The heart and respiratory sounds were shallow.

First diagnosis: sepsis was suspected due to possible post surgery infection.

 

118 ambulance was called

Ambulance confirmed vital signs. ECG: decreased QRS amplitudes, increased QRS duration with left bundle branch block. ABG analysis: SpO2, 88%, PaO2 200 mmHg (80–100 mmHg), FiO2 0.6 (0.22), PaO2/FiO2 290 (> 500); 

 

 

The day after from the ED the RX confirmed no signs of bone consolidation raising suspicion of an infection. 

 

White blood cell count 15,000/µL (4500–7500/µL), Neutrophils 95% (42–74%), Lymphocytes 5.5 (18–50%), Monocytes 8.0% (1–10%), Hemoglobin 6.0 g/dL ( 11.3–15.2 g/dL), Platelet count 38.7 × 104/µL (15.0–35.0 × 104/µL), C-reactive protein 40 mg/dL (0.00–0.30 mg/dL), Blood urea nitrogen 50 mg/dL ( 8.0–20.0 mg/dL), Creatinine 1.60 mg/dL (0.40–0.80 mg/dL), Total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL (0.2–1.2 mg/dL). 

Lactate levels 2.5 mmol/L, (cut off to 2 mmol/L)

 

Therefore, the second surgical intervention consisted of septic debridement, removal of remaining foreign bodies followed by extensive lavage and a girdlestone procedure of the left hip with intraoperative biopsies taken for microbiological analysis. The initial outcomes showed signs of a septic infection.

 

Antimicrobial therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and co-trimoxazole was initiated after K. pneumoniae was cultivated from the removed tissue samples. The microbiological examination revealed two carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains accordingly, the antimicrobial therapy was changed to cefiderocol. Additionally, by mid-week, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis was subsequently detected in all tissue samples collected. Therefore, daptomycin was added to the cefiderocol and colistin regimen.

 

The prognosis was favorable and patient is remitting. ","Diagnosis:

Sepsis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Emergency (Red Code)
* Rationale: The combination of high fever, increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection at the surgical site strongly indicate sepsis. The microbial findings and positive blood cultures for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis further confirm the diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"

A venous line was secured to the cubital fossa after the blood was drawn for a rapid blood examination, and drip infusion of acetate linger solution (500 mL) and normal saline solution (100 mL) with ampicillin sodium (2 g) was initiated. ECG results showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, which raised a concern for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

 

At  the ED admission the blood examination results. Malnutrition was suspected based on albumin (2.3 g/dL) and sodium (127 mEq/L) levels, and severe infection was suspected based on white blood cell count (29,830/µL) and C- reactive protein levels (22.86 mg/dL). After the venous infusion of antibacterial drugs, there were signs of improvement, and a consciousness level of 14 was observed on the Glasgow Coma Scale, with an axillary temperature of 38.5°C, BP 120–130/80-90 mmHg, HR120–140 bpm, and SpO2 of 100% when oxygen was administered at 10 L/min using a face mask. ","Diagnosis:

Septic Shock

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Immediate (Red Code; life-threatening)
* Rationale:
The patient presents with the signs and symptoms of septic shock, including hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, altered mental status, and elevated white blood cell count.
Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
" F 48-year-old Caucasian woman normal weight 

 

I was called by her husband for home visit as she was feeling very bad with sharp abdominal and back pain responding.

 

Clinical history: She had no history of relevant comorbidities or particular risk factors such as immunosuppression.

 

The husband told me that since 3 days the situation got really out of control he described that she started with some nausea, flank pain, urgency to urinate and burning with increased frequency need. 

 

Physical signs: non responsive, shallow breathing, fever, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, burning with urination with hematuria (blood in urine), increased frequency, and urgency. Her abdomen was soft, with generalized tenderness.

 

Vital signs BP 80/53 mmHg; HR 110/bpm, SpO2100%, BT 39 °C; 

 

Suspected diagnosis: possible sepsis due to urinary tract infection (UTI)

 

I called 118 Ambulance with red code to be admitted to ED.

 

The patient had acute central chest pain during ambulance admission, ECG results showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, which raised a concern for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Vital signs BP 80/48 mmHg; HR 110/bpm, SpO2100%, BT 39 °C. Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 30 mm Hg, PaO2 of 61 mm Hg and HCO3- of 23 mmol/L. 

 

 

The patient’s data from from ED were as follow: a brief sedation window was performed, and neurological examination demonstrated a coma state with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5 (Eye 1, Vocal 1T, Motor 3), with a decorticated response to pain, bilaterally myotic pupils with a torpid pupillary response, and a bilaterally positive Babinski sign. Lactate values were 6.2 mmol/l. Right after admission, the patients monitoring was switched from noninvasive to invasive, with cannulation of the left radial artery and monitoring of hemodynamic parameters with the Vigileo system (a device that analyzes arterial blood pressure waveforms and their variations). 

 

The hemodynamic parameters monitored with Vigileo showed cardiac output (CO) 2.1 l/minute (normal range 4.0–8.0 l/minute), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) 350 dyne seconds/cm5 (normal range 800–1200 dyne seconds/cm5) ( MAP 53 mmHg).

 

Blood samples revealed white blood cells (WBC) 11.00 × 103/μl (normal range 4.2–9.0 × 103/µl) (neutrophils 86.0%, lymphocytes 12.6%), red blood cells (RBC) 3.97 × 106/μl (normal range 4.5 –6.1 × 106/µl), hemoglobin (HB) 10.2 g/dl (normal range for women 12–16 g/dl), platelets (PLT) 54 × 103/μl (normal range 150–450 × 103/μl), procalcitonin (PCT) 61 ng/ml (normal range < 0.5 ng/ml), and C-reactive protein (CPR) 17.5 mg/dl (normal range < 0.5 mg/dl).

 

Furthermore, blood PCR analysis was positive for E. coli. The analysis was negative for N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae. Urine microbiological examination was also positive for E. coli, with a total microbial load (colony-forming units, CFU) of 10,000 CFU/ml. The antibiogram showed high sensitivity of E. coli to meropenem. We therefore decided to suspend ceftazole/tazobactam and continue therapy with meropenem.

 

The MRI scan revealed an altered signal and post-contrast enhancement of the leptomeninges. Moreover, multiple T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense and sometimes confluent lesions were detected: in the thalamus, which appeared swollen; in the pons, in the cerebellar peduncles, and in cerebellar hemispheres, also appearing swollen; in the ventricles (mostly in the lateral ventricles and in the occipital horn bilaterally); and in the parahippocampal region bilaterally. All these lesions were also characterized by a reduced diffusivity in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans.

 

 

Diagnosis: pyelonephritis with systemic impairment, fever, sepsis, and altered mental state (pre-coma) due to E coli infection.

 

After 48 hours from the start of Pentaglobin treatment, there was a remarkable improvement in hematochemical and hemodynamic parameters.

 

Patient survived ","Diagnosis:

Septic shock due to urinary tract infection

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with signs of sepsis (fever, hypotension, tachycardia, altered mental state) and has a confirmed E. coli infection in both blood and urine cultures. Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"

Symtoms started 3 days ago with dysuria and pollachiura. At deepp hypogastic palpation patient fell pain. Giordano sign positive bilateraly.  ","Diagnosis:

Acute Pyelonephritis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale: To confirm diagnosis is reccomend urinalysis including the assessment of white and red blood cells and nitrite, urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Evaluation of the upper urinary tract with ultrasound (US) should be performed to rule out urinary tract obstruction or renal stone disease in patients with a history of urolithiasis, renal function disturbances or a high urine pH. Additional investigations, such as a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, or excretory urography should be considered if the patient remains febrile after 72 hours of treatment, or immediately if there is deterioration in clinical status.

Suitable Treatments:
* Antibiotic: Ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg 2 times daily for 7 days, altenative levofoxacin 750 mg  1 time daily for 5 day, Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazol 160/800 mg 2 times daily for 14 days, Cefpodoxime 200 mg 2 times daily for 10 days, Ceftibuten 400 mg 2 times daily for 10 days
* The last 3 antibiotic must be administrered after a IV dose of a long-acting parenteral antimicrobial (e.g. ceftriaxone)
* Supporting treatment such as pain management"

I was called by her nephew, she reported that the patient presented fever up to 40°C, at the moment she is no more responding to any of her call or stimuli.

Since a few days associated with the sensation of pain and burning, stinging, itching of the urethra with frequent urination (dysuria).  while she had been prescribed second-generation cephalosporin for 2 days without any improvement. No other complaints were reported.

 

Clinical history: past medical history was unrevealing.

 

Physical signs: patient in precoma with rigor.  BT 39.4 °C, HR 108/ bpm, BP 80/40mm Hg, RR  25 breaths per minute. Mild peripheral cyanosis and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient presented with a Glasgow coma scale score of 11. Bilaterally myotic pupils with a torpid pupillary response. Cardiac auscultation revealed the presence of an S3 gallop, while rales and wheezing were heard over the lung bases. The abdomen was distended with diminished bowel sounds and there was a positive Giordano sign (gentle hitting of the costiphrenic angle to elicit kidney pain is common practice in patients with suspected renal colic or pyelonephritis) on percussion of the left flank area.

 

I called the 118 Ambulance with Red code

 

Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 29 mm Hg, PaO2 of 62 mm Hg and HCO3- of 21 mmol/L. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia without any ischemic changes. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

 

Suspected diagnosis: UTI possible sepsis

 

The ED admission parameters revealed: raised white blood cell count with polymorphonuclear predominance, anemia, thrombocytopenia, raised aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, elevated troponin (ΤnI) and C- reactive protein (CRP). Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were prolonged and d-dimers were increased, while fibrinogen was reduced. 

 

Microscopic examination of peripheral blood smear revealed several schistocytes and neutrophils left shift. Urinalysis showed pyuria and positive nitrates. Blood and urine cultures were taken on admission. Chest X-ray showed redistribution of pulmonary vessels. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed spleen and left kidney infracts. The patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography, which revealed global left ventricular hypokinesia with left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a large (> 15 mm) mobile mass on the atrial side of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.

 

Patient was supported by administration of intravenous crystalloids 30 mL/kg. Loading doses of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy consisted of intravenous meropenem (2 g), intravenous vancomycin (15 mg/kg BW) and gentamicin (5 mg/kg BW), which were thereafter adjusted according to patients estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR-kidney function parameter). Due to persistent hypotension despite the initial crystalloid fluid challenge, norepinephrine was administered to raise mean arterial pressure at 65 mm Hg. After these therapeutic interventions, hypotension was reversed, and the patient showed gradual clinical and laboratory improvement.

 

E. coli was isolated in all sets of blood cultures and in urine cultures that were taken on admission. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method [5]. The isolate was found to be resistant only to ampicillin (endogenous). Consequently, the treatment was de-escalated and the patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) and ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 h). The patient had a successful clinical response to treatment with resolution of symptoms and signs of infection and improvement of relevant laboratory data within 4 days, while repeated blood cultures turned out negative from the fourth day of antimicrobial therapy. A repeated echocardiography, performed a week after patients admission, showed improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction to 50%, while mitral valve vegetation remained stable. After completion of 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, the patient was in very good clinical condition with normalization of all laboratory abnormalities and was referred for surgical management of endocarditis.  ","Diagnosis:

Septic Shock from Urosepsis

* Probability: Septic Shock from Urosepsis (high probability)
* Emergency: Extremely urgent, life-threatening condition
* Rationale: The patient exhibits signs of systemic inflammatory response, severe sepsis (elevated HR, RR, low BP, fever), and organ dysfunction (elevated liver enzymes, lactate, troponin, and kidney infraction). The presence of E. coli in blood and urine cultures confirms urosepsis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"F 69-year-old, obese, non smoker

 

The husband called me at 3 am.

 

Clinical history: woman with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, obesity with gastric band placement, and right breast cancer status post-lumpectomy. The patients medical history was notably negative for any specific cardiac disease. Her social history was also relatively unrevealing, with the patient denying tobacco use and describing herself as a social drinker of alcohol, although recreational drug use was unknown.

 

Physical examination: Upon my arrival was positive only for chest pain (described as 4/10 in severity at onset), shortness of breath, collaborative, conscious and well oriented.  At the beginning, physical examination was grossly unremarkable. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rate and rhythm with no murmurs or gallops appreciated, and pulmonary examination revealed clear lungs on bilateral auscultation. Nevertheless, after 10 minutes she started being cyanotic, and situation got worsen rapidly. Within 20 minutes the patient developed left upper quadrant abdominal pain and short of breath got even worse.

 

Vital signs: BT 39C∘. She started to be tachycardic with a HR 109 beats/minute, hypotensive with BP 93/60 mmHg, SpO2 92. At this time, bilaterally myotic pupils with a torpid pupillary response was noted and distributive shock was ruled out because the patients cardiac output was also decreased and she had cold and clammy skin.

 

I called ambulance 118 in Red code

 

In the ambulance: physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness with loss of pulse. 

 

Vital signs: BT 39C∘. She started to be tachycardic with a HR 109 beats/minute, hypotensive with BP 93/60 mmHg, SpO2 92.

An ECG was performed in the ambulance showing tachycardia, with an anterior ST elevation consistent with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was started on aspirin, heparin. She underwent non-invasive cannula ventilation 5 lt/pm, and her poor circulatory status was quickly restored with an injection of epinephrine.

 

She was admitted into ED.  The electrocardiogram was ordered in the emergency department, it confirmed tachycardia, with anterior ST elevation and an elevated troponin level of >10,000 ng/dL consistent with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient continued on antiplatelet therapy aspirin and prosugrel, heparin, and statin therapy and taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention.

 

The blood test performed in ED showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.5 cells/L, although her lactate con-centration was only 1 mmol/L. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a splenic infarct, high-grade stenosis of the celiac artery, and mild thickening of the splenic flexure.

 

Transthoracic echocardiography was then ordered, which showed an ejection fraction of 40%, apical and mid/anteroseptal wall hypokinesia, trace pericardial effusion, and no significant valvular pathology. At this time, distributive shock, specifically septic shock, was ruled out because the patients cardiac output was decreased and she had cold and clammy skin as opposed to warm and flushed skin. Hypovolemic shock was ruled out because the physical examination did not reveal dry mucous membranes and CT imaging showed no signs of hemorrhage. Obstructive shock was also ruled out because the patient had no signs of pleuritic chest pain or hypoxia typical of a pulmonary embolus or other causes of obstructive shock. The patient was therefore determined to have cardiogenic shock.

On day 3 of hospitalization, the blood cultures exhibited growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, and a complete blood cell count with differential showed an increase in the severity of leukocytosis with a WBC count of 26 103 cells/L .Therefore, vancomycin was added to the cefepime and metronidazole regimen, and two repeat blood cultures were collected. On day 4 of hospitalization, speciation identified E. faecalis as the causative organism. It was susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, and penicillin. The patient was placed on an antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone at 2 g twice a day and ampicillin every4 hours, and a urinalysis and urine culture were ordered. On day 5 of hospitalization, the patient was still afebrile and her WBC count continued to trend downward.

She was moved to the ED. 

Her blood pressure was 71/46 mmHg. Continuing fluid resuscitation therapy of crystalloids 500 mL/h was continued. Blood test findings showed a remarkably high level of procalcitonin (75.49 ng/mL). An abdominal CT examination showed full stomach and edema of the small intestine were observed. An intra-peritoneal source of infection was not detected preoperatively, but the findings demonstrated a state of severe sepsis associated with severe pan-peritonitis. Therefore, an exploratory laparotomy was performed at 3 h after arrival. 

 

Surgical findings revealed purulent ascites filling the space around the abdominal cavity, but no injury in the gastrointestinal tract. The uterus was intact, but the ovaries and fallopian tubes on both sides were red and swollen. Thus, bilateral salpingitis was considered the cause of the peritonitis. It was decided to preserve the uterine adnexa, and perform peritoneal lavage and drainage. Although 4000 mL of crystalloid fluid was administered in the first intraoperative hour of the 1 h and 27 min of surgery, there was a poor increase in blood pressure and the edema of the small intestine worsened. Therefore, the patient was intubated and managed postoperatively due to the concern of worsening respiratory status caused by the massive postoperative fluid infusion and subsequent diuretic phase.

Clinical history: suffered from an autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder (ALPS) that was treated by splenectomy 24 months before I visited him home. 

 

During the last few days he developed sickness, chills and abdominal pain of sudden onset after heavy exercise I sent him for a general check at nearby outpatient clinic. 

A routine check-up involving ECG, chest X-ray, blood pressure measurement and determination of O2-saturation showed no significant abnormalities. The initial blood results showed slightly elevated leukocyte counts with 11.3 G/L, normal red blood cell counts (4.78 T/L) and normal platelets with 294 G/L (see Table ​Table1.1). The patient received transfusion of 1 L isotonic infusion solution and symptomatic therapy with metamizol and paracetamol.

 

Eight hours later, the mother called me since his general condition worsened rapidly.

 

Physical signs: the patient was not completely alert, was in pain, exhausted and febrile.

Vital signs: BT 40 °C, BP 100/60, HR 120

 

I alerted 118 Ambulance to be hospitalized at ED.

 

In Ambulance 

Vital signs: BT 40 °C, BP 100/60, HR 120, short breathing

ECG evaluation showed tachycardia with ST elevation in precordial lead mimicking an anteroseptal STEMI; ABG pH 6.95, pcO2 21, SB 5, BE -22, pO2 100;Fluid resuscitation therapy of crystalloids 500 mL/h was administered and O2 10 lit/pm.

 

 

ED blood test showed leukopenia (2.8 G/L), his platelet levels were low (108 G/L) and the serum creatinine was elevated (2.0 mg/dl). Hemostasis parameters were also altered (again depicted in Table ​Table1).1). A rapid test for S. pneumoniae-antigen was positive and although antimicrobial therapy was started immediately, the patient developed hemodynamic problems (systolic RR: 50 mmHg) and had to be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU). In spite of catecholaminergic therapy, fluid resuscitation and intubation, the organ dysfunction of the patient deteriorated and he developed severe septic shock with metabolic acidosis (lactate 15 mmol/L), anuric renal failure, overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and fast spreading necrotic skin lesions, resembling purpura fulminans.

 

Upon admission, his hemodynamic and respiratory situation was stable. The metabolic acidosis, however, worsened: lactate levels increased to 18 mmol/L and signs of hepatic impairment were detectable with elevated transaminases and hypoglycemia. Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) levels were massively increased at 6678 U/L and myoglobin values ​​were at 11,500 ng/mL. The skin lesions progressed, and confluent lesions spread over the whole face, both hands and both feet. Hemostasis parameters showed thrombocytopenia (33 G/L), a PT of 31%, an aPTT of >180 s, fibrinogen values ​​of 72 mg/dl and massively elevated D-Dimer levels (72.19 μg/ml), resembling septic coagulopathy with purpura fulminans. According to local and international recommendations, coagulation therapy with a plasma-derived protein C concentrate (Ceprotin®, Baxalta), was initiated. An initial bolus dose of 100 U/kg body weight was given, followed by 10 U/kg/h, aiming for plasma protein C activity values ​​of 100 U/dL. Additional hemostatic therapy consisted of fibrinogen and platelet concentrates, antithrombin replacement (aiming for antithrombin levels of 100 U/dL), and low dose heparin infusion (250 U/kg BW/h). Moreover, extracorporeal renal replacement therapy had to be started because of acute renal failure.

 

Under this treatment the patient could be successfully stabilized. Although CK and myoglobin values ​​continued to increase during the next 3 days and the face and the limbs of the patient were impressively hypoperfused, there were no signs for a compartment syndrome, and no surgical intervention was necessary. After peaking at day 3 upon admission, CK values ​​decreased within the next weeks until returning into the normal range after 4 weeks. In parallel, also the hemostaseological parameters improved and the skin situation improved.

 

The renal situation, however, remained unchanged and until week 4 no sufficient renal function could be established. Therefore, the patient was changed from continuous hemofiltration to intermittent hemodialysis, which was well tolerated. Creatinine levels were constantly high, peaking with 7.95 mg/dl.

 

After 27 days, the patient could be transferred from the intensive care unit to our infectiological ward, where he stayed for another 26 days. Within this stay and under forced fluid substitution, his creatinine levels returned almost into normal range (1.27 mg/dl); also the urine output increased, so renal replacement therapy could be stopped after 4 weeks upon admission. In following, renal function returned to normal. The local skin situation improved constantly, necrotic areas were surgically removed and healed decently.

 

The patient could be finally transferred to a rehabilitation center, from which he was discharged and fully recovered. ","Diagnosis:

"10-year-old girl ED setting

 

Clinical story: She suffered from a rollover trauma by a truck, resulting in an unstable pelvic fracture with a severe decollement of the right trunk. While undergoing treatment in our district, the patient received clindamycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in tracheal secretion). 

 

The girl was then moved to ED for further surgical treatment. After admission, the patient underwent a right-sided hemipelvectomy and negative pressure wound therapy. Despite continued antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam and clindamycin, the patient became septic. A wound biopsy and blood cultures revealed Gram-positive cocci, therefore therapy was changed to linezolid and meropenem. However, even with this broad antibiotic medication, no clinical improvement was observed. Further differentiation revealed a vancomycin-resistant, but teicoplanin-sensitive strain of E. faecium (Van-B VRE). Additionally, a linezolid resistance was detected. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoint for linezolid was >4 mg/l, both at our institutional site as well as at the reference laboratory (Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode, Germany). The antimicrobial therapy was switched to daptomycin (350 mg/day; approximately 8 mg/kg), which was continued for 17 days. Due to this targeted therapy, infection parameters normalized and her clinical status improved rapidly. After secondary wound closure, she was transferred to a rehabilitation center. ","Diagnosis:

Septicemia

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The patient is experiencing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with evidence of bacterial infection as indicated by positive blood cultures, indicating sepsis. Septicemia was further complicated by the identification of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which required specific antibiotics for resolution.

Suitable Treatments:

"A 50-year-old woman ED setting
 
Clinica history: Case known for mitral valve prolapse was admitted to hospital for elective surgery. The patients additional significant medical history included a gastric ulcer, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiac asthma. The surgery lasted for 5 hours; cefuroxim plus tobramycin were administered as antibiotic prophylaxis prior to surgery, according to the local protocols. Postoperatively the patient had to be resuscitated; an intra-aortic balloon pump was required to wean the patient off of the heart-lung machine. 
After the patient was successfully resuscitated, she was transferred to the intensive care unit, where she remained intubated and ventilated for 29 hours. Eight days after the operation Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the femoral wound, but antimicrobial treatment was not applied. The patient was afebrile. Her white cell count was 8.4 x 109/liter, C reactive protein level was at 78mg/liter and the sedimentation rate was 84mm/hr. Two days later, the patient had a leukocyte count of 14.75 x 109 /l, a CRP of 38.42 mg/l, and a WE of 60 mm/h were measured. 
 
The patient was moved to ED for the second time. At that time the femoral wound required binding. Six months later, no wound infection was detected at the control examination. This is the first report of isolation of vanA carrying E. faecalis in Apulia, and this is the first demonstration of vanA carrying E. faecalis in Apulia confirmed by sequence analysis. Surprisingly, this patient never received vancomycin. It is also possible that the vancomycin resistance emerged in the medical staff members and was nosocomially transmitted to the patient. However, the environmental, staff and patient screening were negative for VRE. Although, the patient had never received vancomycin therapy, she may have been more susceptible to environmental pathogen bacteria due to multiple severe concomitant diseases. ","Diagnosis:

"A 49 year old male obese and smoker ED setting

 

He was admitted to ED with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, and chills for the past two weeks. He describes the pain as sharp and located on the left side of his chest. 

Past medical history is non-contributory, except for current IV drug use. 

Vital signs: BT 36.5 ° C, BP 141/63, HR 87, RR 18 with an oxygen saturation of 91-93% on room air. 

Physical exam: a regular rate & rhythm with no murmur or regurgitation was noted and lungs showed fine bilateral crackles. 

 

His white blood cell count was increased at 22.1 TH/cm2 and troponin I was also elevated at 0.19 ng/ml. Blood cultures were collected and the patient was started on ceftaroline and piperacillin tazobactam for presumed infectious endocarditis. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated due to respiratory distress. An echocardiogram revealed a large mobile vegetation on the aortic valve with severe insufficiency and a vegetation & thickening of the mitral valve with severe regurgitation.

 

Blood cultures were positive within 24 hours of collection and gram positive cocci arranged in pairs and chains were noted (Image 1). Enterococcus spp., vancomycin resistance not detected was reported by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Small, gray, non-hemolytic colonies grew after 2 days of incubation (Image 2). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified the isolate as Enterococcus faecalis.

 

Ampicillin or vancomycin are acceptable treatment options for Enterococcal infections if found to be susceptible by antibiotic testing. It is important to note, Enterococcus spp. are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin. For serious infections, including infective endocarditis, treating with a cell wall active agent such as ampicillin and an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or streptomycin) is recommended to create a synergistic bactericidal effect. The emergence of E. faecium acquired vancomycin resistance (VanA/VanB) is increasing and more board spectrum agents such as daptomycin and linezolid are necessary to effectively treat these infections. 

 

In this, upon identification of E. faecalis from multiple blood cultures, his antibiotics were switched to IV ampicillin and gentamicin. He underwent valve replacement surgery and the aortic and mitral valves grew E.faecalis and showed numerous bacterial cocci on histology. He completed a six-week course of ampicillin and gentamicin and was discharged home in good condition.

 ","Diagnosis:

Infective Endocarditis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The presence of a large, mobile vegetation on the aortic valve with severe insufficiency and similar findings on the mitral valve is highly indicative of IE. The patient’s IV drug use is a significant risk factor for this condition. Elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci arranged in chains, specifically Enterococcus faecalis, strongly support this diagnosis. The detection of vegetation with echocardiography confirms the diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotics"

She was moved to ED with fever and weakness over the last few days. The patient was feeling agitated during the physical examination. She also complained of left back pain. Her medical history included poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.

 

She was drowsy. Her vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.5 °C; pulse rate, 102 beats/min; respiratory rate, 28 breaths/min; blood pressure, 122/54 mmHg (noradrenaline 0.5 microg/kg per min); and pulse oxygen saturation, 98% with high flow oxygen therapy. Diminished breath sounds in the right lower lung were heard on auscultation. There was no audible cardiac murmur. Her abdomen was soft but she failed to cooperate with the abdominal tenderness examination, along with mild pitting edema of both lower limbs. The patient was diagnosed with emphysematous pyelonephritis and septic shock, possibly caused by a gas-producing uropathogenic infection.

Laboratory results demonstrated that her white cell count was 27,700 cells per cubic millimeter (the normal range: 3,500 to 9,500). The C-reactive protein level was 32.873 mg per deciliter, the blood urea nitrogen level was 20.70 mmol per liter, and the creatinine level was 312.7 μmol per liter. Urinalysis showed an elevated leukocyte count and bacteriuria. A CT scan in horizontal plane sectioning showed that the left kidney was significantly enlarged with thickened perirenal fascia, which was related to the presence of gas in the renal parenchyma and the kidney pelvis. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and treated with meropenem and broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics.

 

Unfortunately, the patient developed acute renal failure and was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy. After active treatment, the clinical effect was remarkable. Her clinical symptoms and serum inflammatory indicators  improved gradually, and she stopped using norepinephrine (day 3). Her renal function (day 3) also recovered , and she was successfully weaned with continuous renal replacement therapy. On the third day, both blood and urine cultures reported extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli. The patients condition continued to improve, and she no longer needed to be treated in the ED on the 6th day. The patients abdominal CT scan (day 12) revealed that the gas collection in the pelvis and calyces had disappeared. Finally, the patient was discharged. ","Diagnosis:

History of benign prostatic hyperplasia, nephrolithiasis, and coronary artery disease status/post coronary artery bypass graft. Right flank pain, followed by fever, chills, sickness, abdominal pain, and nausea. He took acetaminophen for pain. He denied dysuria, gross hematuria, prior urethral stricture, diarrhea, poor dentition, or alcohol use. He flosses daily and follows with his dentist regularly, with teeth cleaning 1 month prior to presentation. He denied recent sexual activity. Physical exam was positive for fever (38.0 degree Celsius), tachycardia, and diaphoresis. Capillary refill was normal. 

 

He was admitted to ED. Initial laboratory results showed mild leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury with creatinine 2.2, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 29. Urine showed microscopic hematuria and small leukocytes. Computed tomography abdomen/pelvis demonstrated moderate right hydronephrosis  and a 10 mm right ureteral stone and multiple nonobstructing left renal calculi. 

The patient was treated with aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid hydration and IV Ceftriaxone. Urology was consulted, and a right ureteral stent was placed. Due to unresolving sepsis, antibiotics were broadened to IV Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Blood and urine cultures resulted positive for S. sanguinis. Infectious disease was consulted for treatment of his streptococcus bacteremia. Additional workup was negative for infectious endocarditis including a transesophageal echocardiogram. Antibiotics were de-escalated to IV ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. The patient completed a 2-week course of IV ceftriaxone. Follow-up blood cultures remained negative, and his renal function normalized. The right stent was later exchanged with lithotripsy of the right renal calculus.

 

The iliopsoas abscess was resolved by percutaneous drainage and medical treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam. There are few documented cases of iliopsoas abscess caused by urinary tract infections, which were primarily posturologic interventions and in association with ureteral stones.

Patient was also found to have a right renal calculus and hydronephrosis which was likely the source of the S. sanguinis urinary sepsis. The medical literature has documented penicillin susceptibility for Streptococcus sanguinis to be 60%. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin susceptibility was shown to be 92% and 100%, respectively. The guidelines for infective endocarditis recommend penicillin G and ceftriaxone as 1st-line therapy for viridans streptoccus endocarditis.  ","Diagnosis:

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients symptoms (fever, chills, flank pain), laboratory findings (leukocytosis, hematuria), imaging results (hydronephrosis, ureteral stone), and positive blood/urine cultures (S. sanguinis) are consistent with a severe urinary tract infection progressing to sepsis.

"A 78-year-old woman overweight non smoker (Dentistry and Oral-Maxillo Surgery Department)

 

It was requested re-fabrication of the upper and lower partial dentures and underwent an initial examination at our general dental department on February 20 2024. 

 

The patient had a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal calculi and was taking trichlormethiazide , warfarin potassium, and fluvastatin sodium tablets; therefore, her blood pressure, lipid levels, and renal calculi were within normal ranges.

 

The lower partial dentures were re-fabricated and re-fabrication of the upper partial dentures was planned once the adjustment of the lower partial dentures was complete.

 

On April 16 the patient was experiencing intense instability (tooth mobility level 3) in the upper left molar region, so the procedure was re-scheduled to take place after extraction of the tooth . At that point, no marked reddening or swelling of the upper left molar region was observed, and tooth extraction was scheduled to be performed at a later date. Dental X-rays of the upper left molar region indicated marked alveolar bone resorption.

 

Subsequently, the patient experienced spontaneous pain and swelling in the upper left molar region and was examined at general dental department on April 24. Pus discharge from the periodontal pocket was observed, and the area was cleaned and sterilized with normal saline solution and iodoglycol paste. Loxoprofen sodium was prescribed as an analgesic.

 

A few days later, the swelling spread to the left buccal region and spontaneous pain became more intense, leading to more difficulty while eating for 2–3 days. On April 28, the primary care physician instructed the patient to back to hospital. That day, upon examination  the Glasgow Coma Scale score was 11. The patient was immediately referred to the dental anesthesiology department, and the physical findings included facial pallor, cold hands and fingers, and shivering. Palpation indicated a weak radial artery pulse, and the vital signs were as follows: axillary temperature, 41°C; systolic blood pressure, 80–90 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure, 40–50 mmHg; pulse rate, 130–160 bpm; and SpO2, 75%–85%.

 

Based on the physical findings and vital signs, dehydration and septic shock were suspected. 

 

Oxygen administration at 10 L/min was immediately initiated using a face mask. A venous line was secured to the cubital fossa after the blood was drawn for a rapid blood examination, and drip infusion of acetate linger solution (500 mL) and normal saline solution (100 mL) with ampicillin sodium (2 g) was initiated. Blood examination results referred to possible malnutrition based on albumin (2.3 g/dL) and sodium (127 mEq/L) levels, and severe infection was suspected based on white blood cell count (29,830/µL) and C- reactive protein levels (22.86 mg/dL). After the venous infusion of antibacterial drugs, there were signs of improvement, and a consciousness level of 14 was observed on the Glasgow Coma Scale, with an axillary temperature of 38.5°C, systolic blood pressure of 120–130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120–140 bpm, and SpO2 of 100% when oxygen was administered at 10 L/min using a face mask.

 

Subsequently, the patient was transferred to ED and blood examinations were performed; the results showed high levels of D-dimer (23.98 µg/mL) and fibrin degradation products (38.6 µg/mL) were found; thus, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was strongly suspected. Therefore, the patient underwent systemic management in intensive care unit. However, her condition worsened at around midday on the following day, and her death was confirmed at 9:22 p.m. on April 29.

 

On the following day, the patients family requested an explanation regarding the treatment at our hospital. The general dentistry department manager, dental anesthesiologist, and relevant office staff explained the patients course and state to her until the emergency transfer and the treatment that she was given, which her family understood. Furthermore, the family mentioned that the patient may have had lung cancer based on the findings of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography performed at the general hospital, which indicated pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltration, and pulmonary shadows.

 ","Diagnosis:

Sepsis/Septic Shock

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Immediate
* Rationale: The patients vitals, specifically elevated temperature (41°C), hypotension (80-90/40-50 mmHg), tachycardia (130-160 bpm), and low SpO2 (75%-85%), along with physical signs of dehydration, indicate sepsis. The rapid clinical deterioration, marked increase in white blood cell count (29,830/µL), and elevated C-reactive protein (22.86 mg/dL) further support the diagnosis.

Vital and physical signs: facial pallor, quite confused, redness, mild swelling, and pain in the right arm. She was in circulatory shock with a blood pressure of 60/48 mmHg, pulse rate, 91 beats per minute (bpm; regular); respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; SpO2, 97% (room air); body temperature, 37.7 °C.
 
Blood tests showed high levels of inflammation, and computed tomography of the upper arm revealed adipose tissue turbidity. It was suspected septic shock, with the infection originating in the upper arm.
 
To stabilize blood pressure, it was administered 1000 mL of lactated Ringers solution, an initial dose of meropenem 1.0 g after blood culture specimens were collected, and noradrenaline at 0.2 µg/kg/minute. Then, under local anesthesia, a 5-cm incision was made distally from the medial right upper arm and proximally from the medial right cubital fossa. The color tones of the subcutaneous fat and fascia were normal, and it was suspected cellulitis rather than necrotizing fasciitis. For the septic shock, it was continued to administer meropenem (3.0 g/day) for 12 days, with linezolid (1.2 g/day) for 5 days and immunoglobulin (5 g/day) for 3 days via intravenous injection. On day 2 of hospitalization, a blood culture detected Gram-negative bacilli, and linezolid was discontinued. On day 5 of hospitalization, V. vulnificus was identified by blood culture, and we added minocycline (100 mg) twice daily for 8 days, to which V. vulnificus was susceptible (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, the inflammatory findings rapidly improved; the patients C-reactive protein levels dropped from 9.3 to 1.1 mg/dL in 9 days. Although there was no history of seafood intake or contact with seawater, we learned that the swelling developed in her right hand 1 day after she had shelled a large number of raw shrimp for cooking, and the swelling spread to the trunk. Therefore, we believed that the route of V. vulnificus infection was through minor skin wounds inflicted by shrimp shells.
 
The disease course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 25 of hospitalization.  The medical staff suspected liver disease and measured serum anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody levels, leading to the diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis. ","Diagnosis:

Vibrio vulnificus Septicemia with Secondary Cellulitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The onset of symptoms following shelling raw shrimp and the identification of *Vibrio vulnificus* in the blood culture are strong indicators. The rapid progression of symptoms, including redness, swelling, and septic shock, aligns with a serious soft tissue infection.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"patient was a 78-year-old Male in ED setting from territorial medical guard and 118 Ambulance

 

The son called me for home visit 

 

The patient complained of 24 hours duration of pain, swelling and redness of his left dorsalis pedis. He had fever and was confused. 

 

His previous history included gastroenteritis after having shrimps with his wife. He also had gastroenteritis he was prescribed antibiotics but after initiating medication the patient became unconscious. 

 

His past medical history included bipolar disorder, multiple myeloma, osteoporosis, earlier pituitary tumor and development of frontotemporal dementia.

 

On physical examination, his Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 3, BP 79/38mmHg, HR 115 beats/minute, SpO2 60%, RR 40 breaths/minute, BT 39 °C. 

 

In the ambulance he was treated with metaoxedrine, epinephrine, clemastine, oxygen and isotonic sodium chloride. Before entering ED he was awake and had GCS 9, BP 87/43mmHg, HR 110 beats/minute, SpO2 90%, RR 35 breaths/minute. 

 

He was treated with methylprednisolone, ciprofloxacin and meropenem. ABG pH 7.11, lactate 4.8mmol/L, PaO2 11.9, PaCO2 34, bicarbonate 17mmol/L and hemoglobin 4.2mmol/L. 

 

He went hypotensive again and developed a cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, epinephrine was administered and return of spontaneous circulation was observed after 2 minutes. Sedation and intubation was performed and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). A nurse observed diffuse redness on his left foot, high temperature, petechiae and pain. His right lower leg had petechiae too and minor edema. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 175mg/L, white blood cells 1.0×109/L, platelets 56×109/L and the treatment with meropenem and ciprofloxacin continued combined with metronidazole and fluconazole.

 

A cardiac echo revealed ejection fraction >55%, a minor mitral valve deficiency and a well-preserved left ventricle. Treatment with inotropic agents was initiated, using norepinephrine because of volume-resistant hypotension and decreased urine output.

 

The next day an orthopedic surgeon assessed  suspicious of necrotizing fasciitis. On his left foot there was redness, bullae, cyanotic toes and there was no palpable pulse in the dorsalis pedis artery. Microscopic examination found Gram-negative bacteria after Gram-stained smears in all samples from the patient. The treatment with meropenem and metronidazole continued. His CRP was 284mg/L.

 

The microbiology identified Vibrio metschnikovii in all his blood samples using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. It was suggested treatment with meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam since the antibiotic susceptibility tests found the bacillus to be sensitive to these antibiotics. His CRP was 318mg/L. He went to surgery and wound necrosis was found on top of vital tissue. 

 

Treatment with ciprofloxacin was canceled and the next step was either treatment with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system or in worst case amputation. His CRP was 262mg/L.

 

The following days his CRP decreased, this urine output increased and at that time the only antibiotic he was taking was piperacillin / tazobactam. The wound healing improved day by day, but he remained sleepy and needed mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy was established 13 days after admission and he slowly improved during the following days of weaning from the ventilator. During this period he underwent surgical revision twice.

 

Piperacillin/tazobactam was discontinued and the tracheostomy was replaced with an uncuffed tube as he now could manage spontaneous respiration. He was transferred from ICU to internal medicine department 20 days after admission to hospital. A VAC system was established on his left foot and split-skin transplantation was performed 5 weeks after admission to hospital. He was still in hospital 3 months after admission.

 ","Diagnosis:

Septic Shock

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Emergency
* Rationale: The patient presented with a high fever, hypotension, high lactate levels, and confusion, hallmark features of septic shock. Blood cultures confirmed the presence of Vibrio metschnikovii, a known pathogen that can cause severe sepsis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"53 yo M, smoker, overweight

This patient has a past medical history of ischemic cerebral ischemia due to a foramen ovale in 1997, closure of that foramen in 2010. He went to the territorial medical guard for left flank abdominal pain and fever, the doctor prescribed anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen) and paracetamol. After 4 days he went to ED. 

Vital signs: BT 38.6 °C, HR 100 bpm, BP 120/80 mmHg, SpO2 98%. The left flank was sensitive at palpation without rebounds pain. Doctor prescribed blood test and arterial gas analysis that showed acute inflammation, with WBC 17.2× 109/L (leucocytosis) and a CRP value at 337 mg/l. Hemoglobin, hemostasis parameters, creatinine, liver and pancreatic tests were within the normal ranges. Arterial blood pH and lactate values were also normal. He also performed CT that showed a necrosis of the spleen with air, associated with a thin ipsilateral pleural effusion.

Suspected diagnosis: spleen necrosis, spleen abscess, sepsis.

Initial therapy:  fluid challenge (3 l of crystalloids), antibiotic (ceftriaxone and metronidazole), transfer to intensive care unit for monitoring, blood cultures

The blood cultures were positive for Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus gallolyticus. Antibiotics were switched to amoxicilline-clavulanate and clindamycin, the latter for its potential effect on clostridial toxin production through interference with ribosomal protein synthesis. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasonography was performed and showed a normal cardiac function without valvular dysfunction nor endocarditis. After 12 h, was performed a splenectomy by midline incision. Samples of peri splenic purulent liquid were harvested. The spleen was exposed, allowing visualizing a voluminous perforated abscess. The spleen was extracted. After local washing, a drain was left in place, the abdominal wall was closed using absorbable stiches and a prophylactic cutaneous negative therapy device was applied. Perioperative bacteriological samples were positive for Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus gallolyticus and Clostridium baratii. The patient stayed 24 h in perioperative care unit before returning to the ward. The drain was removed after 6 days and antibiotics were continued for 14 days. Endocarditis was definitively excluded using transoesophageal ultrasonography. To rule out associated pathology of the gastro-intestinal tract, a colonoscopy was performed and was normal. The patient was vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumonia, Neisseria meningitidis and Influenza, before being discharged 17 days after admission. Microscopic pathologic examination showed also a ruptured aneurysm of a branch of the splenic artery, surrounded by a splenic infarction. ","Diagnosis:

spleen rupture, spleen abscess, spleen infraction, sepsis

* Probability: Very high
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: Symptoms of fever, left flank pain, elevated WBC count, high CRP, presence of necrosis and gas on CT, and positive blood cultures indicating infection all strongly suggest a splenic abscess.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotic, support therapy"
"64 yo female, ED setting, autonomous

Medical history of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia 

She came in hospital because of fever and pain on the left hip joint. She underwent cemented THA on the left hip joint with transtrochanteric approach at 63 years old the symptoms appeared suddenly 9 months after the operation. 

On admission vital sign: BT 38.4°C, BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, SpO2 99%. 

Patient alert, collaborative, oriented. The left thigh was swollen and tender. Blood examination showed her WBC × 109/L   and CRP was 24.7 mg/dL. Was performed RX that was normal. However, T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (RMN) showed high-intensity area around her left hip joint and gluteus. We tried arthrocentesis, but very poor amount of synovial fluid appeared. Hence, we performed synovial fluid culture, but cell count was not available. She was started intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/day from the day of admission after collecting of samples of blood culture, but both blood and synovial fluid culture turned out to be negative. 

First diagnosis: prothesis infection, sepsis

First therapy: arthrocentesis, blood culture, site culture, antibiotic (ceftriaxone 1 g/day), antiobiogram 

To identify the causative bacterium, we remove the wire in her greater trochanter and debride granulation and synovia on the 26th day. From multiple pieces of the trochanteric wires, granulation, and synovia, Y. enterocolica was detected, and it was susceptible to ceftriaxone. We suggested revision arthroplasty to her, but she never agreed because the symptom subsided, so we continued treatment by antibiotics. Her symptoms subsided, and CRP kept negative, so we changed the antibiotics to oral ciprofloxacin which was susceptible to the causative bacterium on the 61st day and we continued the treatment to the 74th day. She discharged on the 76th day. No recurrence has been seen in 24 months after the discharge. ","Diagnosis:

"a 64-year-old Japanese female overweight and smoker (Dental ED)

History of Cogan&#39;s syndrome was brought by 118 ambulance to ED due to her high

fever, chills, and dizziness. She was emergently hospitalized because of hypoxemia

and cardiac insufficiency.

The initial examination showed hypoxemia (SpO2 81%), tachycardia (pulse rate

130/min), and high fever (39.4°C). Her level of consciousness was I-1 (JCS) and her

blood pressure was 97/56 mmHg. Echocardiography showed pulmonary

hypertension (RVSP 110). A CT scan showed bilateral pulmonary congestion and

obvious pulmonary artery dilatation. A blood test showed a low white blood cell count

(WBC 3900, Neutrophils 80.1%), anemia of chronic disease (RBC 321 × 104/μL, Hb

9.7 g/dL), thrombopenia (PLT 14.7 × 104/μL), and increased inflammatory response

(CRP 10.07 mg/dL).

The patient had been diagnosed with Cogan&#39;s syndrome in 2008, which had shown

(1) vestibular disorder, (2) auditory disorder, (3) ocular inflammation, (4) aortitis, and

(5) hypertrophic pachymeningitis/meningitis since 2006. She also had autoimmune

hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Since symptoms (1–3) had been stable since the

diagnosis, she underwent a cochlear implantation and a cataract operation. She had

been taking 14 mg prednisolone for the prior seven years as the primary treatment

for Cogan&#39;s syndrome and was consequently in immunocompromised status. She

had been taking an alendronate (bisphosphonate) for 2 years and 9 months.

At this time, sepsis was suspected and empirical antibiotic treatment was started

with i.v. meropenem (1 g every 8 h). Although the infectious focus had not been

identified, the physician in charge suspected odontogenic infection as one of the

candidate infectious foci, because she had been complaining of a toothache in the

left mandible. Cellulitis of unknown cause in the left ankle had been observed 2 days

before here hospitalization and she was also considered as another candidate for

the infectious focus.

To investigate the possibility of odontogenic infection, the patient was referred to our

department of oral and maxillofacial surgery 5 days after her hospitalization. Gram-

positive cocci had been detected in her venous blood culture at the initial

hospitalization. However, the species of the bacteria had not yet been identified. Just

 

before the hospitalization, the pain in her left lower molar had been so severe that

she had sometimes been unable to sleep. However, at her first presentation of her in

ED, the only thing she described was discomfortness of the left lower molar, and no

acute symptoms were observed.

As clinical findings, no inflammatory reactions such as swelling of the gingiva,

discharge of pus, severe dental caries, or periodontitis were apparent in the oral

cavity including the region about which the patient complained. The oral hygiene

condition was quite well. Only slight percussion pain was observed in the left

mandibular molars. The maximum obtainable probing depth of the left mandibular

first molar and second molar was 6 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The other maximum

obtainable probing depths were all 2 or 3 mm. However, Touch Test Sensory

Evaluators showed hypoesthesia of the left lower lip with the complaint of numbness

of the region (Vincent&#39;s symptom), which suggested the possibility of the presence of

mandibular osteomyelitis.

Pantomography and dental X-ray indicated furcation involvement of the left

mandibular first molar. The furcation involvement was classified into the Class II by

the classification by Hamp and Nyman and Lindhe&#39;s classification. In addition,

interestingly, marked and independent swelling of the buccal alveolar bone at the left

mandibular first molar was observed. On the day following the patient&#39;s first visit to

the oral and maxillofacial surgery department, the gram-positive cocchi turned out to

be S. constellatus, which is known to be part of the normal flora in the oral cavity.

This result suggested that the infectious focus was in the patient&#39;s oral cavity and

prompted us to conduct a closer examination of the oral lesion.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not an option for this patient because she

had undergone a cochlear implantation, but an enhanced computerized tomography

(CT) scan indicated the mixture of acute and chronic osteomyelitis in the left

mandible.

First suspicion that the acute symptoms of chronic osteomyelitis in her left mandible

could have led to the systemic infection. The furcation involvement and/or dental

caries in the left mandibular first molar was/were considered the primary focus of her

current acute symptoms. Therefore, first the metal crown was removed on the left

mandibular first molar. Because of the effect of the initial empirical administration of

an antibiotic, no suppuration was observed, but a clear carious lesion expanding

from the branch of the roots to the distal root was observed. Specimens from the soft

dentin of the carious lesion was sampled for a culture-test, which revealed

methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis

(Group D streptococci). This result implied that there had been an aggressive battle

between the antibiotics administered to the patient and invasive bacteria. Medical

staff removed as much of the infected soft dentin of the left mandibular first molar as

possible, and the molar was eventually extracted under the administration of i.v.

vancomycin (1 g every 12 h) and p.o. clyndamycin (300 mg every 8 h) after the

patient’s general condition had recovered. ","Diagnosis:

Sepsis due to odontogenic infection

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale: Correctly diagnosed by the engine

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"

The symptoms started with fever (BT 37.5°C), weakness, loss of concentration, dry cough. The cough was very intense and frequent (4-5 cough hit simultaneously). After few days the cough became productive and appeared vomit. The vomit characteristics were not associated to a gastric pathology or to meal, it was poor, sometimes he vomited only his saliva. The symptoms get worse at evening. There not sign of viral infection like wheezing or rhinorrhoea. The cough, in the first days dry, was associated to catarrh or yellow or white color.

"A 2 yo M patient child, territorial and ED setting. Relevant clinical history of early preterm birth and bronchopneumonia. 

He presented to territorial doctor a 7 day history of cough and fever. The child was immediately transferred to the Children’s Assessment Unit at the local university hospital. On examination the child had a RR of 60 breaths per minute and a HR of 180 bpm; was febrile and had a cough and wheeze. A chest radiograph showed nothing abnormal. The child was given salbutamol (through nebulisation) which improved oxygen saturation from 93% to 99% and was discharged with a diagnosis of viral wheeze. Blood sample for routine investigations along with a pernasal swab was taken during this consultation.

First diagnosis: viral wheeze

Therapy: anti-inflammatory drugs

The following day the child was seen by his regular family doctor and was found to be afebrile, well in himself and had a mild expiratory wheeze. He was given steroids (prednisolone) for 3 d and a delayed prescription for amoxicillin. As the cough and wheeze still persisted the child’s parents ensured this course of antibiotics was completed. However the child remained unwell with cough and minimal wheeze even after this.

A pernasal swab was collected in the Children’s Assessment Unit of the local University Hospital which was received in the microbiology laboratory on the same day. The sample was processed as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the laboratory.

Oxidase test revealed a positive reaction (B.parapertussis gives a negative oxidase reaction). A slide agglutination test with B. pertussis polyvalent antiserum gave a positive result. Based on these tests performed in the laboratory, a presumptive diagnosis of B. pertussis was made. The isolate was subsequently referred to the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory for confirmation.

 

Further tests were performed on the isolate at the HPA’s Pertussis reference laboratory and was confirmed to be Bordetella pertussis serotype 1 and serotype 3.

Confirmation from the microbiology laboratory, together with the clinical diagnosis led to the conclusion that the vaccination had failed or persistence of vaccine-induced protection was weak. The child was prescribed Azithromycin, 125 mg every 6 h for 7 d. The child was seen again by the family doctor two weeks later and was still coughing and had a wheeze. On this occasion Clarithromycin, 62.5 mg twice a day for 7 d was prescribed. Following this the child completely recovered and was given a booster vaccination.  ","Diagnosis:

Bordetella Pertussis Infection

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The positive slide agglutination test, the oxidase test, and further confirmation at the Pertussis reference laboratory make this a definitive diagnosis. The clinical history and symptoms (persistent cough, preterm birth history, and bronchopneumonia) align with pertussis.

"7 yo M patient, ED setting.
He was admitted to the ED having had fever for 6 days, headache, vomiting, maculopapular rash, severe abdominal pain, conjunctival hyperemia, photophobia, raspberry tongue, hyperemia with lip desquamation, right cervical lymphadenomegaly, and edema. In addition, he experienced mild tachypnea without respiratory symptoms when breathing normal room air.
On admission, the patient underwent a fluorescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 to test for the presence of reagent immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, with titers >30.0 AU/mL (normal, <1.4 AU/mL) and antibodies nonreactive to immunoglobulin M (IgM), with a titer of 0.1 AU (normal, <1.1 AU). The mother reported that the child had flu-like symptoms 1 month before admission. Laboratory tests indicated inflammatory responses (Table 1). His C-reactive protein measured 96 mg/dL, blood count showed lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; hypoalbuminemia (2.3 g/dL); hypertriglyceridemia (262 mg/dL); and increased levels of transaminases, ferritin (1812 ng/mL), d-dimer (8500 ng/mL), and troponin (0.26 ng/mL). The patients blood type was O positive. Serology tests for dengue IgG and IgM and anti-HIV were nonreactive. Serology tests for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex 1 and 2, and rubella were all negative. Blood culture for aerobic and anaerobic microbes using selective media showed no bacterial growth. Urine culture also revealed no bacterial growth.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus revealed that these viruses as undetectable. PCR of nasopharyngeal and rectal samples showed SAR2-CoV-2 as undetectable. The patient had normal C3, C4, and CH50 serum complement levels. Other test results included negative direct Coombs, normal reticulocytes, and a normal simple urine test. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed moderate bilateral pleural effusion associated with fissure thickening on the right, interlobular septa thickening, mild infectious/inflammatory opacity, and mild pericardial effusion. The abdominal CT scan showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue edema and large amounts of free fluids in the abdominal and pelvic cavities. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed aneurysmal dilation of the right coronary and left main coronary arteries:
Diagnosis: mis-c
Therapy: support therapy, antibiotic prophylaxis 
The patient received intensive support and was treated with antimicrobials (ceftriaxone, oxacillin, and azithromycin) and received intravenous human albumin. In addition, MIS-C was treated with a single IVIG dose of 2 g/kg by continuous infusion over 10 h, with the aim of promoting anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action and ASA, initially at the oral anti-inflammatory dose of 80 mg/kg per day (6/6 h) until the child became afebrile after 48 h and the oral maintenance dose was reduced to 5 mg/kg per day, single oral dose, as an antiplatelet agent, indicated by the presence of coronary dilations.
Two weeks after IVIG and ASA administration, while still hospitalized, the patient experienced a seizure crisis. His consciousness level lowered, and coma eventuated. He was intubated and managed with neuroprotective and anticonvulsant measures. The patient also had increased liver enzymes. Laboratory tests showed significant liver function damage (Table 1) and an ammonia level of 150 μmol/L. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected with a cell count of 6/mm3, normal protein (33.9 mg/dL), and normal glucose (66.32 mg/dL). Other results included negative CSF Gram stain bacterioscopy and liquor culture without growth. Latex agglutination reactions were performed with specific antibodies for groups A, B, C, Y, and W-135 Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and type B Haemophilus influenzae, and these were all undetectable. Electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform activity. Blood was detected in the feces and fecal leukocytes. Skull CT demonstrated no abnormal changes.
Suspected diagnosis: sepsis
Therapy: antibiotic, support therapy
Initially, the diagnosis of sepsis of hospital origin was considered, with meropenem and teicoplanin being prescribed. The patient received blood components, including red blood cells, fresh plasma, and vitamin K for severe coagulation disorders. In addition, he was administered sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, and ventilation control was provided. It was also necessary to administer vasoactive amines.
At that time, the patient was still using ASA; after clinical and laboratory investigation of the patient, the diagnosis of Reyes syndrome was given, as ASA is associated with such a syndrome, with the switch from ASA to clopidogrel, in one initial dose of 1 mg/kg per day, in order to maintain the antiplatelet activity.

"58 yo F patient, type 2 diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, smoker, ED setting, came by ambulance.
She presented to our hospital with reduced consciousness and respiratory failure. She had been coughing for a few days and had lost >6 kg in weight over the previous 6 months. Three days before presentation, she left the hospital against medical advice after being admitted for a flare of her recurrent pancreatitis. After she had left the hospital, a blood culture had revealed the presence of S. pneumoniae. Since there were no clinical signs of infection, antibiotics were withheld, but the general practitioner was instructed to start antibiotics in case of fever. On arrival, she was taking oxycodone, oxycontin, supplemental medication for pancreatic insufficiency and hydrochlorothiazide. She was an active smoker but denied drinking alcohol. On the day of readmission, she was found on the floor and was transported by ambulance to our emergency department. She appeared cachectic and ill with decreased consciousness.

She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). She was intubated and received haemodynamic support, high-dose cefotaxime and steroids. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed a bacterial infection. Four separate blood cultures were positive for S. pneumoniae. The culture of cerebrospinal fluid showed no growth but was taken after initiation of antibiotics. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation of 24x12 mm on P2P3 of the mitral valve and severe regurgitation due to perforation.
￼
 Coronary angiography was performed which revealed significant two vessel obstruction. Despite a high embolic risk because of the large vegetation size, surgery was postponed due to haemodynamic and respiratory instability. 
After 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy, no embolic events had occurred, concurrent mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting were performed without periprocedural complications. She recovered well. Antibiotic therapy with cefotaxime was continued for a total of 6 weeks, fever remained absent and CRP low. She was discharged. ","Diagnosis:

I ordered the admission to ED in red code

ED settings  Chest x-ray and ultra sound revealed left mid and lower zone consolidation with minimal pleural effusion (Fig. 1). Laboratory evaluation revealed hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL. His WBC count was 15.9 × 103/mm3 (neutrophils 74%, eosinophils 1%, lymphocytes 26%, monocytes 5%). Serum creatinine was 1.6 g/dl.

He was initiated on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and non invasive ventilation for mild ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). On day 4 of hospital stay, his breathing mechanics worsened and he was initiated on mechanical ventilation in view of worsening ARDS and pneumonia. Endotracheal aspirate culture initially revealed Staphylococcus aureus which was subsequently turned out to be contaminant. To rule out pulmonary tuberculosis two samples were sent for AFB smear (Acid Fast Bacillus) examination and were found to be negative. Mycobacterial culture was sent. CT thorax on day 8 showed bilateral extensive areas of consolidation (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) with multiple small cavitating nodules (Fig. 5). Special stain for Nocardia was done on the broncho-alveolar lavage – Kinyoun stain was done which revealed weakly acid fast branching bacilli. Culture of the BAL was done on 5% Sheep blood agar and chocolate agar which revealed chalky white colonies after 3 days of incubation. These were identified Nocardia sps on staining morphology on Grams stain and Kinyoun stain. He was initiated on trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole. Subsequently he had VAP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia) with gram negative bacteria, and was treated as per sensitivity. Tracheostomy was performed and weaned off ventilator. ","Diagnosis:

Community-Acquired Pneumonia

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High. The patient presents with severe respiratory distress, requiring immediate medical attention and intensive care.
* Rationale: The patients symptoms (cough, breathlessness), physical examination findings (tachypnea, tachycardia, harsh breath sounds, bilateral expiratory wheeze), and radiological findings (left mid and lower zone consolidation) are consistent with pneumonia. The rapid deterioration of the patients condition, requiring mechanical ventilation, suggests the development of ARDS.

Suitable Treatments:
* broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"A 28-year-old man, normal weight, no smoker, occasionally drinker without known systemic disease.  He had intermittent fever for 2 days, accompanied by sore throat, general malaise and poor appetite. There was no productive cough, rhinorrhea, skin rash or eschar, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary symptoms or flank pain. He recently traveled to Northern Europe, Holland, and had a party on a grassland one week before these symptoms developed, but he denied similar symptoms in his family members and friends. 
On physical examination, he presented with an enlarged and exudative tonsil on the right side, and mild right neck swelling. 
SpO2 98; HR 89; BP 129/80
Suspected diagnosis: tonsillitis 
 
 
The day after situation got worse therefore I ordered ED admission
The chest x-ray showed no obvious pneumonia patch or pleural effusion. The laboratory data showed leukocytosis with thrombocytopenia, liver enzymes abnormalities and raised C-reactive protein (CRP). 
He was admitted under the impression of acute tonsillitis with reactive neck lymphadenopathy and suspected EBV infection. Empirical antibiotics treatment with Flomoxef and doxycycline for scrub typhus (fever, increased liver enzymes and history of picnicking on the grassland) was administered. Abdominal ultrasound showed mild splenomegaly and mild ascites and no gallbladder wall thickness or biliary tract obstruction; this supported the diagnosis hepatitis. However, the serology of mycoplasma antigen and antibody and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) titers showed no active infection. His fever persisted under antibiotic treatment. Worsen sore throat with right neck swelling, productive cough and mild shortness of breath were observed. Blood cultures taken at the ED reported gram-negative bacilli; thus, they escalated antibiotic regimen to doripenem. A computed tomography (CT) scan for deep neck infection was performed and shown right tonsil swelling, with lymphadenopathy and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (Figures 1). In addition, follow-up chest X-ray showed right pneumonia with pleural effusions (Figure 2). The final blood culture reports revealed Fusobacterium necrophorum for two sets. He was diagnosed with Lemierres syndrome. (F. Necrophorum bacteremia, internal jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis, metastatic infections with pneumonia and pleural effusions). They moved to the ED of dentistry to consider bacteremia from an odontogenic infection, and there were dental caries and chronic periodontitis. There were residual roots, and he underwent tooth extraction. Heart sonography reported no obvious vegetation. When his fever subsided, we de-escalated the antibiotic regimen to ceftriaxone and metronidazole, and followed up with two sets of blood cultures. The patients clinical symptoms improved, and the right neck mass subsided. The patient reported that his sore throat of him, productive cough, shortness of breath and neck pain had resolved. The follow-up blood cultures showed no growth in five days for two sets. After three weeks of antibiotic treatment, he was discharged and followed up at the outpatient department. ","Diagnosis:

Lemierres Syndrome

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High (requires immediate medical intervention)
* Rationale: The presence of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, right tonsil swelling, lymphadenopathy, and a confirmed blood culture of Fusobacterium necrophorum strongly suggest Lemierres syndrome. This diagnosis also matches the patients worsening clinical signs and development of pneumonia with pleural effusions.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"A 70-year-old patient was admitted to the Department of Rheumatology, Emergency County Hospital, Craiova, Romania, in May 2018, following an ongoing and worsening pain and swelling of the left ankle in the last two months. The patient has a long history of type II DM, with secondary neurological and vascular complications. Other past disease history included a coronary angioplasty 14 years ago and arterial hypertension. Home medication consisted of antihypertensive drugs, oral antidiabetics, and platelet antiaggregant. He has had persistent arthralgias in the hands for the past four years which we’re recently labeled as seropositive RA.

Since diagnosis of RA, the patient was started on Leflunomide and Sulfasalazine immunosuppressive drugs.

He developed a plantar lesion at the ball of the left foot, in the past one year, which was labeled as malum perforans in the setting of DM. The ulceration has since persisted and started to display features of an infectious process with purulent discharge after four months. At that time, the patient was managed in an Orthopedic Department for local debridement and close follow-up. Cultures drawn from the tissue were positive for S. aureus. After an antibiotic course, the apparent infectious features were remitted, but the long-lasting open wound failed to improve.

Upon admission in the Rheumatology Clinic, the patient presented with intense pain in the left ankle, with marked joint instability, limited range of motion and need of a walking aid and ankle orthosis. On physical examination, the ankle joint showed overall swelling, erythema, tenderness, and increased pain during movement. Local weightbearing could not be performed. Other joint symptoms were not evident, with no apparent signs of an active RA. Results of blood tests on admission showed an important inflammatory syndrome, with high values for both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and a moderate anemia, with normal erythrocyte indices. The results are shown in Table ​Table1.1. The patient underwent multiple US examinations for guided fluid aspiration and follow-up. An X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left ankle were also performed.

Imaging evaluation

Musculoskeletal US was the primary imaging technique used to define the location and extent of the infectious process. On admission, US assessment revealed significant changes related to a potential joint infection (Figures ​(Figures11 and ​and2).2). Anterior scans displayed increased joint effusion of the tibiotalar joint, with extension on the lateral aspect of the joint. Marked tenosynovitis of the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis tendons was also detected. The joint effusion displayed an overall inhomogeneous hypoechogenic content with scattered hyperechoic spots. Following close examination of the extent of the joint collection, an US-guided fluid aspiration was performed. A total of 30 mL of joint fluid was evacuated and microscopic analysis of the sample drawn displayed evident purulent features. The sample was sent for further cytology and microbiology studies. Confirmation of a S. aureus etiology through positive joint fluid culture allowed for a targeted antibiotic therapy course. During the follow-up period, the patient underwent additional US exams. Although no significant change was seen in the following scans regarding the quantity of joint effusion, further fluid aspiration failed to obtain significant samples due to a very thickened content. A slight benefit for better aspiration was obtained through joint lavage using saline solution. Left ankle MRI scans confirmed the presence of arthritis and tenosynovitis with additional diffuse bone edema of the tibial epiphysis, talus bone (Figures ​(Figures33 and ​and4).4). X-ray image displayed important structural changes in the form of cortical irregularities, periarticular demineralization, and joint space-narrowing.

Management and outcome

Antibiotic therapy was initiated in accordance with culture sensibility tests. We opted for a 14-day intravenous course of fluoroquinolone – Moxifloxacin 800 mg/day. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, analgesic and Sulfasalazine therapy was maintained, with discontinuation of Leflunomide. The patient displayed clinical improvement after one week, with pain reduction and better range of joint movement. Unfortunately, the apparent clinical response did not correlate with the follow-up US scans, which revealed persistent joint and peritendinous effusion.

The plantar lesion showed no development of local inflammation or infection, and surgical approach was not recommended at that point.

Before ending the two-week antibiotic course, the patient developed acute decompensated heart failure, massive pleural effusion and was referred to the Cardiology Department. The opportunity for surgery was once again postponed following this flare and fluoroquinolone therapy was extended for additional two weeks. The patient was lost to follow-up after discharge from Cardiology Department. Short- and long-term outcome was unfavorable with both treatment unresponsiveness and comorbidity burden posing considerable difficulties. ","Diagnosis:

Septic Arthritis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The presence of swelling, pain, erythema, and the positive joint fluid culture for Staphylococcus aureus strongly point towards septic arthritis. The high CRP and ESR levels corroborate an inflammatory and infectious process.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"Venezuelan male in his early 60s who developed AKI as a result of urinary retention status post bilateral nephrostomy tubes placed last month. The patient presented with progressively worsening polyarthralgia, difficulty walking for two days, fever, and diaphoresis for one day. The patient had an uneventful dialysis session the day before his symptoms began. No sick contacts, recent falls, injuries, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, rashes, or changes in urine collections have been reported.

 

In the month prior to admission, the patient had been diagnosed with bladder outlet obstruction, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Computerized tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis revealed bilateral hydronephrosis but no hydroureters. A workup was performed to rule out pyelonephritis. A foley catheter was inserted, and a urinalysis report revealed no evidence of growth. Initially, the patient was treated with gentle hydration, and his blood pressure was monitored regularly. Despite all efforts, the patients renal function did not improve. After one week of admission, bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tubes were placed, and a serial basic metabolic panel was monitored. After placing the bilateral PCN tubes, the patients blood urea nitrogen level remained elevated at 143 mg/dL, while his creatinine level remained elevated at 13.2 mg/dL, resulting in a decision to begin hemodialysis. The right internal jugular permcath was placed, and the patient began hemodialysis. The patient was hemodynamically stable, with no sign of infection, and a normal complete blood count (CBC) with WBC count, discharged from the hospital and was referred to dialysis and was to follow up with a urology outpatient. Twelve days after the placement of the dialysis catheter, the patient was discharged home. The patient had no prior medical conditions except benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and his family and social backgrounds are unremarkable. Two days after the hospital discharge, he underwent his first outpatient hemodialysis session, which was uneventful, and he returned home relatively well. The outpatient hemodialysis session was conducted two weeks following the placement of the dialysis catheter.

 

Upon examination, the following vital signs were noted: Temperature: 101.7°F; blood pressure: 98/57 mmHg; pulse: 125 beats per minute; respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute; and SpO2: 89%. The patient was alert and oriented and did not appear to be in any acute distress. There were no notable findings during the physical examination other than diffuse bilateral swelling, redness, and warmth of the shoulders, ankles, knees (right knee was more affected than left), elbows, hands, 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP), and wrists, as well as red rashes and pain with movement in affected joints. Over the next two days following the prescription of antibiotics, the patients symptoms improved. The results of laboratory work are summarized in Table 1.

TS. aureus bacteremia was likely related to tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) infection, leading to polyarthralgia, septic joints, and echocardiogram report showed mobile echo density on anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, likely diagnosis of infective endocarditis.

 

The patient developed symptoms 24 hours after undergoing outpatient hemodialysis. Blood cultures from two peripheral sites were positive. Antibiotics were started on the first day of admission following the collection of peripheral blood cultures. The urine culture was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the nephrostomy culture was positive for Enterococcus faecalis, which is different from the blood culture, which was positive for S. aureus. Blood cultures from the catheter tip were not obtained as the antibiotic had already been administered for two days, and there was no evidence of infection at the catheter site.

During treatment, the patient was prescribed nafcillin 2 g every four hours and was then switched to cefazolin (2 g/100 mL) upon discharge. The patients right knee joint was washed out. A contaminated TDC was removed from the right side, and a new one was placed on the left. PCN tubes were replaced on both sides. ","Diagnosis:

Infective Endocarditis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of mobile echo density on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve observed in the echocardiogram and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus clusters strongly suggest infective endocarditis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"A 58-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with left hip pain and limited mobility for 1 week. The pain was obvious on admission, and the visual analog scale score, which is a pain score used to evaluate the severity of pain by visual simulation and divided into 10 equal parts using a ruler, with 0 indicating no pain, 1–3 indicating mild pain, 4–6 indicating moderate pain, and 7–10 indicating severe pain, was 5. His medical history revealed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, gout, and urinary stones. Prior to the onset of hip pain, he had a history of heavy physical labor. The patient had no obvious history of trauma or signs of infection elsewhere in the body. His vital signs on admission were as follows: temperature, 37.0 °C; pulse, 67 beats/min; respiration, 18 cycles/min; and blood pressure, 118/70 mmHg. Physical examination findings were as follows: good general condition, clear respiratory sounds bilaterally, and normal heart sounds and rhythm with no pathological murmurs. There was no obvious pelvic deformity, and the skin over both hips was intact with no redness, swelling, or rupture. Although not warm, the skin showed deep tenderness at the midpoint of the groin in the left hip (+). The “4” test revealed the left hip (+) and right hip (−). The Thomas sign was positive and negative on the left and right hips, respectively. Other findings were as follows: pelvic separation squeeze test (−); and longitudinal percussion pain in the left lower extremity (+) and right hip (−). The range of motion of the left hip was as follows: flexion, 80°; extension, 0°; external rotation, 20°; internal rotation, 20°; abduction, 10°; and adduction, 10°. The range of motion in the right hip was normal. The motion sensation and blood supply in the affected limbs were good, with no obvious abnormalities.

 

The results of auxiliary tests on the first day of admission were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, 9.22 × 109/L (neutrophils, 67.9%; lymphocytes, 9.8%); hemoglobin concentration, 124 g/L; platelet count, 231 × 109/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 14 mm/h; and C-reactive protein, 10.2 mg/L. Pelvic plain radiographic images were suggestive of a deformed left femoral head, narrowed hip space, and osteophyte hyperplasia (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left acetabular bone marrow edema and a small amount of fluid in both hip joints (Figure 2). Chest radiograph showed no significant substantial lesions in both lungs (Figure 3). On admission, the patient was initially diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the left hip. Owing to the relatively obvious pain and left acetabular bone marrow edema, the patients condition was thought to be related to acetabular bone contusion caused by heavy physical labor. Joint replacement surgery was planned, with no administration of anti-infective therapy. On the 7th day after admission, the patient developed a persistently high retained fever over 38°C, and the hip joint pain was significantly aggravated. Laboratory tests revealed the following: WBC count, 13.42 × 109/L (neutrophils, 8.38 × 109/L); C-reactive protein, 381.1 mg/g; interleukin-6, >5000.0 pg/mL; and procalcitonin, 31,830 ng/mL. Left hip joint infection was accordingly suspected. After joint aspiration examination, blood culture, and drug sensitivity test, 1.5 g of cefuroxime sodium was given intravenously twice a day. After 5 consecutive days of treatment, this patients condition did not improve, and chest tightness, dyspnea, and decreased blood pressure occurred. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation, anti-infection, homeostasis, and organ function protection. Pulmonary computed tomography revealed multiple pneumonocytocystic changes in the lungs, suggestive of S. aureus infection (Figure 4), and joint puncture and blood culture confirmed the aforementioned suspicion. Considering the patients condition, we suspected S. aureus bacteremia had spread to various parts of his body, including the lungs (Figure 4) and brain (Figure 5). According to the results of the drug sensitivity test (Table 1), the antibiotic treatment regimen was adjusted to an intravenous drip of tigecycline at 100 mg for the first dose and 50 mg for each subsequent dose every 12 h, all while maintaining the stability of organ function, circulation, and acid-base balance. Nonetheless, continuous treatment for 2 weeks still had a poor therapeutic effect. Two weeks after admission, the patient developed multiple organ dysfunction in the respiratory, circulatory, nephrological, and pancreatic systems, as well as in other systems. His condition gradually deteriorated, and the patient died of multiple organ failure 1 month after admission.

Septic Arthritis

* Probability: Medium
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents a persistently high fever, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin), and findings from both joint aspiration and MRI. The rapid onset of symptoms and deterioration indicates acute joint infection. Infections by S. aureus are common in septic arthritis.

Suitable Treatments:
* broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"14-month-old African Tanzanian female who presented at our hospital with left knee pain and swelling that extended to the lower one-third of the thigh for three days. In addition, she also had diarrhea and abdominal pain for about four days. She suffered three motions per day of loose mucoid stool which was foul-smelling. The symptoms were accompanied by fever and anorexia. She was given ampiclox and analgesics before admission with no improvement. On examination, her weight was 9 kilograms with a height of 83 cm, weight for height z- score of -2 SD, alert, in pain, febrile 38 ° C, weak and pale. She was unable to bear weight on the left leg and her left knee was in a flexed internally rotated position with a visibly swollen left knee joint and lower one-third of the thigh (Figure 1). It was tender to touch with a reduced range of movement, inflamed and warm. The right leg examination was normal. The initial provisional diagnosis included septic arthritis, amoebiasis, moderate anemia, moderate malnutrition, and with differential diagnosis of cellulitis, reactive arthritis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and sickle cell disease. The complete blood count depicted neutropenia of 0.76 x 103 /UL, a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, a mean corpuscular volume of 56.0 fL, a mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 33.1 g/dL, and platelets of 103 x 103/UL ( Figures 2). The random blood glucose was 5.5 mmol/l and Entamoeba histolytica cysts were detected in the stool. Haemoglobin electrophoresis was done with HbAA detected ruling out sickle cell disease. A rapid HIV antibody test was non-reactive both for the child and the mother. X-ray of the left knee (Figure 3) showed a flexed and rotated left knee joint with bulging of the peri-articular fat pads without significant joint space widening nor juxta-articular osteopenia. A correlative ultrasound of the left knee showed hypoechoic intra-articular free fluid in the left knee joint demonstrating echogenic debris with marked periarticular soft tissue fat stranding with increased vascularity on the surrounding tissues suggestive of an ongoing infectious/inflammatory process or arthritis. Blood culture and sensitivity samples were taken however, the results came back with no bacterial growth. The general surgeon and orthopedic surgeon were called to review the case and the patient was then initiated on amoxiclav, metronidazole, and acetaminophen and she kept on maintenance intravenous fluid. Arthrocentensis of the left knee joint was done with a clear straw color synovial fluid aspirated of which culture came back with no bacterial growth and gram stain showed white blood cell proliferation. The following day her condition deteriorated with episodes of high-grade fever, an increase in pain, and swelling of the left knee. A decision was made to change antibiotics to intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Over the night she developed difficulty in breathing with her oxygen saturation dropping to 70% on ambient air and was kept on oxygen therapy via face mask 10L/min with an improvement of 98% measured by pulse oximeter. On systemic examination, she had tachypnea (respiratory rate 62 breaths per minute) with vesicular breath sounds. Mother also reported that she had vomited blood once over the night and on examination she had scleral jaundice. Acute liver failure and septic embolism were suspected secondary to the septic arthritis. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and further investigations were done. Chest x-ray, allowing for rotation to the right, showed a segmental heterogeneous airspace opacification obscuring the right cardiac border suggestive of right middle lobe consolidation (Figure 4). Liver function tests were elevated with an aspartate transaminase level of 2046U/L, hypoalbuminemia of 2.2 mg/dl, total bilirubin was elevated to 9.21 mg/dl with direct bilirubin 8.3 mg/dl. Control complete blood count (CBC) showed leukocytosis and the haemoglobin level had dropped to 6.8 g/dl (Figure 5). Arterial blood gases were not available at the facility at that moment. Still, we had a high index of suspicion of metabolic acidosis and an empirical stat intravenous dose of sodium bicarbonate was given. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were elevated at 20 mm/Hr and 9.5 mg/dl respectively. The echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Multiple episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded and resuscitation with Dextrose 10% and then Dextrose 5% Normal Saline (DNS) alternating with ringer lactate as a maintenance fluid regimen. She was transfused 180mls of whole blood and since platelets dropped the next day at 65 x 103 /UL (Figure 6) with visible oral mucosal and gum bleeding an additional transfusion of platelets 128mls and 135mls of fresh frozen plasma were given. Vancomycin was initiated unfortunately she had a hypersensitivity reaction developing generalized body swelling and therefore it was stopped. Meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole were initiated with hoping of covering nuisance organisms such as Kingella kingae, salmonella, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and gram-negative bacteria. Metronidazole was maintained to eradicate Entamoeba histolytica. Since biochemistry investigation revealed hypoalbuminemia, high liver enzymes (Aspartate transferase and Alanine Aminotransferase), hypoglycemia, high total bilirubin with high direct bilirubin and thrombocytopenia in CBC, an additional diagnosis of acute liver failure secondary to sepsis was confirmed. Prothrombin time/ International normalized ratio and partial thromboplastin time were unfortunately unavailable. Therefore, in addition to her prior management of her, she received dexamethasone, tranexamic acid, albumin, and kept nil per oral. Daily vitamin K injections were also given for three days. The following day she improved with her haemoglobin level rising to 10.8 g/dl and platelets to 111 x 103/UL after the transfusions. She stayed in the ICU for a total of five days and was transferred to the pediatric ward when her liver enzymes, bilirubin, and glucose levels normalized, and she was clinically stable. After 2 days in the ward, her left knee swelling became localized and fluctuant. A second arthrocentesis revealed pus and an incision and drainage arthrotomy of the pyogenic arthritis was indicated. Under general anesthesia whereby a right knee distal thigh swelling 6 x6 cm fluctuant and shiny was examined followed by a sterile procedure medial aspect of the left knee joint cruciate incision arthrotomy and a gush of about 350mls of pus was drained which extended to the knee intra capsule with capsule of the opened and irrigated with normal saline one liter then with pivodone iodine and wound covered with gauze and supported with crepe bandage (Figures 7,8). A pus sample was taken for culture and gram staining for fastidious organisms, anaerobic, aerobic gram-positive, and gram-negative aerobic bacteria. After seven days all results showed no bacterial growth and gram stain showing an infiltration of white blood cells. Her complete blood count still showed leukocytosis and a low haemoglobin count of 8.5 g/dl but the reticulocyte count was within the normal range. In addition, her CRP dropped to 4.2 mg/dl after three weeks on intravenous antibiotics. She was then initiated oral clindamycin and had daily drainage and dressing with physiotherapy initially done under sedation until she improved. The pus decreased and after 3 weeks of clindamycin her hemoglobin level on follow up 9.5 g/dl with leucocyte of 12 x 103/L. At her follow-up clinic her complete blood count had returned to normal apart from the mild anemia of 10.5 g/dl (Figure 9) of which she was kept on iron therapy and her CRP was within normal range. The family was counseled on dietary requirements in addressing moderate malnutrition with high calories, protein content with fruits and vegetables to address micronutrients and vitamins. She was in addition given multivitamins. Her follow-up plan included a bi-weekly visit for nutrition, physiotherapy, and assessment by both pediatrician and orthopedic. She progressed well and was expected to make a full recovery (Figure 10). ","Diagnosis:

Septic Arthritis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale: The patient presented with knee pain, swelling, inability to bear weight, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP). Initial poor response to antibiotics and the presence of joint effusion confirmed by ultrasound and X-ray are indicative.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"A 71-year-old woman with a recent history of urinary tract infection (UTI) presented to our neurosurgery service for disturbed consciousness. Other than the UTI, she had no particular medical history, including lifestyle diseases. On admission, she had spastic dysarthria and right-sided cerebellar ataxia as well as mildly disturbing consciousness (E3V4M6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale). Neurological examination showed bilateral (right > left) lower limb weakness, and Babinski’s and Chaddock’s signs were positive on her left side. Although her pupillary reflex was normal, her drowsiness interfered with the detailed cranial nerve examination. The results of the electrocardiogram, blood glucose level, and lipid profiles were normal and showed no risk factors related to stroke. The computed tomography (CT) scan showed a high-density area considered to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage, mainly localized to the right cerebellopontine cistern and in the right parietal convexity (Figure 1A). The magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple acute infarctions in the right cerebellum, cerebellar peduncles, and lateral pons (Figure 1B). The angiography showed that there was an interruption in the middle of the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery and the right superior cerebellar artery. Sinus thrombosis was not observed. Conservative management of stroke was started. 

 

The Babinski reflex is part of the routine neurological examination to evaluate the integrity of the corticospinal tract. However, in settings where patients withdraw with plantar stimulation, or if there is a lesion on the lateral plantar aspect of the foot, evaluation of the Chaddock reflex offers a reasonable alternative to the Babinski reflex. Both the Babinski and Chaddock reflex test the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST). When a lesion occurs anywhere along this corticospinal tract, the examiner may obtain a positive reflex. The examiner watches for dorsiflexion (upward movement) of the big toe and fanning of the other toes. This is referred to as a ""positive reflex,"" or one may state that the ""reflex is present."" When there is a downward deviation of the toes, this means the reflex is absent. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, performance, and interpretation of the Chaddock reflex and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in assessing patients with neurological deficits.

B) Magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted image of cerebellar infarction on admission (circled).

 

 

Although the patient had no fever upon admission, her laboratory tests on admission revealed that her initial white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) level were highly elevated (Figure 2). We conducted extensive bacterial culture screening of the urine, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood immediately after she was admitted. Although she had a high fever (39 °C) on the next day of admission, it was initially considered to be a stroke-induced inflammatory reaction. A detailed blood examination (WBC: 29000/µL, CRP: 21. 4 mg/dL, platelets: 106000/µL, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio: 1.22, activated partial thromboplastin time: 53.0 s, D-dimer: 7.37 µg/mL, blood urea nitrogen: 32 mg/dL, creatinine: 0.89 mg/dL, procalcitonin: 0.9 ng/mL) suggested the existence of systemic sepsis.

Besides, a meticulous physical examination for fever revealed that her lower limbs were stiff and in a flexed position, which appeared irrespective of the stroke (Figure 3A). This odd limb position prompted us to conduct imaging studies of lumbar areas, and they revealed bilateral severe iliopsoas abscesses and pyogenic lumbar spondylitis with spinal extradural abscess (Figures ​(Figures3B,3B, ​,3C).3C). Empirical treatment with meropenem was initiated based on these findings. On day two, CT-guided iliopsoas abscess drainage was performed. Also, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was identified from the urine culture on admission. On day four, MSSA was identified from the iliopsoas abscess drained culture as well. This result suggested that her systemic infection primarily started from UTI and it proceeded through pyelonephritis. The antibiotics were changed according to the results of the antibiotic sensitivity test on day eight (Figure ​(Figure2,2, lower part). Echocardiographic screening detected severe mitral regurgitation due to infectious mitral valve disruption. Radiological resolution of the brain, spinal, and iliopsoas abscesses was confirmed after multiple antibiotic courses for six weeks. Her neurological deficits, such as dysarthria and ataxia, gradually improved. Care was then taken by the cardiothoracic surgery team, who performed a two-staged valve replacement. Multiple disruptions caused by infection were confirmed in the mitral valve (Figure ​(Figure3D).3D). The postoperative course was uneventful. After 19 weeks of intensive management, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with no neurological deficit. Continuous administration of antibiotics to prevent recurrence of the infection will also be continued appropriately.

Septic emboli causing multiple cerebral infarctions and subarachnoid hemorrhage

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients neurological deficits, fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and imaging findings of multiple cerebral infarctions and subarachnoid hemorrhage suggest septic emboli as the primary cause.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),  ventilation support (mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is preferred)"
"A 78-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to hospital with new onset confusion and fever. He was pyrexial (38.2°C), but examination was otherwise unremarkable. Blood glucose was 13.7 mmol/l, chest X-ray was normal and urinalysis was negative. Lactate was 1.8 mmol/l. The working diagnosis was of delirium due to an infection (source unknown). CT head showed likely incidental mucosal thickening of both maxillary antra. Empirical treatment with i.v. amoxicillin and gentamicin was commenced. Two days later, he was found to be globally aphasic with a homonymous hemianopia and dense right hemiparesis. He remained pyrexial despite antibiotic treatment. CT head remained unchanged.

Intravenous acyclovir and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin and metronidazole) were commenced. Lumbar puncture revealed an unremarkable CSF profile with the exception of a minimally raised protein (0.58 g/l). PCR testing was negative for enteroviruses, Herpes simplex and Varicella zoster. CSF bacterial culture was negative. Anticonvulsants were administered to cover for the possibility of subclinical status epilepticus.

Within 48 h his condition had significantly improved; he was moving his right side, had no evidence of visual field defect, and was able to speak. CT angiogram of intracranial vessels showed no evidence of cerebral vasculitis and a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging showed no stroke or other intracranial pathology. An organism was isolated from the anaerobic bottle of a set of blood cultures after 24 h incubation using the Vitek 2® (Biomerieux) automated analyser. Gram-positive cocci forming clusters and chains were seen on a microscopy. (Figure 1) The aerobic bottle remained negative. The organism grew slowly on Columbia agar with horse blood and chocolate agar plates. Small grey colonies which were catalase and oxidase negative were visible (Figure 2). 16rRNA ribotyping by the Health Protection England Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections Reference Unit identified it as Facklamia languida. F. languida is the only Facklamia spp which forms clusters supporting the identification. A diagnosis of F. languida septicaemia, leading to presumed (unwitnessed) seizure and Todds paresis, was made based on the sudden onset and recovery of severe focal neurological deficits and the negative brain imaging. However, it is possible that these deficits were purely defunctioning secondary to sepsis. The patient went on to make a full recovery and was discharged home.

Facklamia species are rarely reported from clinical specimens. There have been two reports in the literature of Facklamia hominis causing infective endocarditis, with one case presenting as ischaemic stroke secondary to the endocarditis, but there are no published descriptions of stroke-like syndromes associated specifically with F. languida bacteraemia. Since its discovery in 1999, the only published descriptions of clinical cases we could identify were isolates from six invasive infections all of which were from women. These were of a CSF isolate from a case of meningitis, a gallbladder isolate and four bloodstream isolates. Consequently, the epidemiology and clinical associations for this organism are currently not understood and, as further cases are reported, greater understanding of the behaviour and range of disease manifestations of this extremely rare human pathogen will become clearer along with its optimal treatment.

 

Stroke mimics are common; about a quarter of patients initially suspected to have a stroke are subsequently found to have an alternative diagnosis. A systematic review found that of patients subsequently identified as having a stroke mimic, 19.6% had seizures and 9.6% had sepsis. Many conditions, particularly in the elderly, can produce transient neurological deficits and to label them as stroke or TIA is potentially dangerous. The underlying condition may be more serious but also potentially treatable. ","Diagnosis:

Facklamia languida Septicaemia

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of gram-positive cocci in blood cultures, which grew slowly in anaerobic conditions and subsequent identification using 16rRNA ribotyping as Facklamia languida, confirms the diagnosis. The initial symptom of fever and confusion alongside negative cultures for most common pathogens aligns with a rare bacterial sepsis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Antibiotics: Continue the broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole) until further clinical stabilization
* Transition to targeted antibiotic therapy once susceptibilities are determined
* Supportive Care: Fluids, fever management, and monitoring for organ dysfunction"
"A 74-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department in a somnolent state of consciousness with left gaze preference, aphasia, and right-sided hemiparesis (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS-score: 17). The symptoms were first realized after awakening. Cranial computed tomography and angiography revealed a left-sided infarction in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory caused by a peripheral MCA occlusion (Fig. 1). In addition the patient showed signs of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) (body temperature 41.1 °C, heart rate 140/min, respiratory rate 17/min, leucocytes 4.17 × 10^3/ul, C-reactive protein (CRP) 54.3 mg/l, platelet count 111 × 10^3/ul). Intravenous fluid therapy was started immediately. After acquisition of blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), an empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, ampicillin and aciclovir was initiated. Soon after, the patient required cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the setting of septic shock. After intubation and cardiopulmonary stabilization the patient was admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit. CSF examination showed 390 leucocytes/ml, elevated lactate (5.52 mmol/l) and protein levels (2783 mg/l) as well as normal glucose levels (66% of serum levels). Immediate Gram staining of CSF revealed partially elongated, Gram-positive rods without spore formation. Because of their size and appearance Listeria spp. could be ruled out and Bacillus spp. or Clostridium spp. were suspected (Fig. 2a). Therefore the antibiotic therapy was escalated with vancomycin. On the following day anaerobic blood cultures grew also Gram-positive rods with some of them showing endospore formation (Fig. 2b). Aerobic blood cultures remained sterile. Accordingly, sepsis and meningitis by Clostridium spp. were assumed. Culture results confirmed this tentative diagnosis and the bacteria were identified by mass spectroscopy as Clostridium septicum. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that the strain was sensitive to penicillin G, imipenem, clindamycin, vancomycin and metronidazole with minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.023 mg/l, 0.006 mg/l, 0.032 mg/l, 0.75 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Respiratory specimens and urine were unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiography did not show endocarditis and there was no sign of an infection focus in ear, nose, throat or the sinuses. The further course was characterized by a persistent severe septic disease pattern with high demand of catecholamines, strong increase of inflammation parameters (leucocytes max. 42.86 × 103/ul, procalcitonin (PCT) max. 177.32 ng/ml, CRP max. 398.8 mg/l). The antibiotic therapy was switched to high dose penicillin G and clindamycin. The inflammatory parameters started to decrease approximately 48 h after initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy. However, because the patient showed a persistent loss of brain stem reflexes after initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it was decided to change the therapy to a palliative regimen. The patient died two days post admission. Due to the fact that no obvious risk factors for Clostridium septicum bacteremia were present (e.g. infected wounds, myonecrosis, diabetes mellitus, severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, neutropenia, liver cirrhosis), a previously unknown gastrointestinal focus of infection was most likely [4]. Accordingly, autopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma of the colon ascendens with 2.8 cm in diameter as entry site of the pathogen.

Acute Ischemic Stroke due to MCA Infarction

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: Given the NIHSS score of 17, left-sided infarction in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory with typical symptoms such as left gaze preference, aphasia, and right-sided hemiparesis, the patient is experiencing an acute ischemic stroke.

Suitable Treatments:

"The 25-year old male caucasian patient suffered from an autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder (ALPS) that was treated by splenectomy 24 months before this event. He had no previous episodes of severe infections. In March 2014, he developed malaise, chills and abdominal pain of sudden onset after heavy exercise, and contacted his nearest outpatient clinic. A routine check-up involving ECG, chest X-ray, blood pressure measurement and determination of O2-saturation showed no significant abnormalities. Blood results showed slightly elevated leukocyte counts with 11.3 G/L, normal red blood cell counts (4.78 T/L) and normal platelets with 294 G/L (see Table 1). The patient was sent home after transfusion of 1 L isotonic infusion solution and symptomatic therapy with metamizol and paracetamol. Eight hours later, the general condition of the patient worsened rapidly and he had to be hospitalized because at that time he had already developed leukopenia (2.8 G/L), his platelet levels were low (108 G/L) and the serum creatinine was elevated (2.0 mg/dl). Hemostasis parameters were also altered (again depicted in Table 1). A rapid test for S. pneumoniae-antigen was positive and although antimicrobial therapy was started immediately, the patient developed hemodynamic problems (systolic RR: 50 mmHg) and had to be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU). In spite of catecholaminergic therapy, fluid resuscitation and intubation, the organ dysfunction of the patient deteriorated and he developed severe septic shock with metabolic acidosis (lactate 15 mmol/L), anuric renal failure, overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and fast spreading necrotic skin lesions, resembling purpura fulminans. Thus, the patient received fibrinogen (Haemocomplettan®, CSL Behring) and prothrombincomplex (Beriplex®, CSL Behring) alongside clindamycin, linezolid and intravenous immunoglobulins (Pentaglobin®, Biotest Pharma GmbH) and was transferred to our intensive care unit at the Medical University of Vienna. Upon admission, his hemodynamic and respiratory situation was stable. The metabolic acidosis, however, worsened: lactate levels increased to 18 mmol/L and signs of hepatic impairment were detectable with elevated transaminases and hypoglycemia. Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) levels were massively increased at 6678 U/L and myoglobin values were at 11,500 ng/mL. The skin lesions progressed, and confluent lesions spread over the whole face, both hands and both feet. Hemostasis parameters showed thrombocytopenia (33 G/L), a PT of 31%, an aPTT of >180 s, fibrinogen values of 72 mg/dl and massively elevated D-Dimer levels (72.19 μg/ml), resembling septic coagulopathy with purpura fulminans. According to local and international recommendations, coagulation therapy with a plasma-derived protein C concentrate (Ceprotin®, Baxalta), was initiated. An initial bolus dose of 100 U/kg body weight was given, followed by 10 U/kg/h, aiming for plasma protein C activity values of 100 U/dL. Additional hemostatic therapy consisted of fibrinogen and platelet concentrates, antithrombin replacement (aiming for antithrombin levels of 100 U/dL), and low dose heparin infusion (250 U/kg BW/h). Moreover, extracorporeal renal replacement therapy had to be started because of acute renal failure ","Diagnosis:

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The positive S. pneumoniae antigen test, sudden onset of symptoms post heavy exercise, severe deterioration, documented hemodynamic instability, metabolic acidosis, organ failure, and the development of purpura fulminans all align closely with septic shock secondary to bacterial infection.

"A 64-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with fever and weakness over the last few days. The patient was feeling agitated during the physical examination. She also complained of left loin pain. Her medical history included poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. Laboratory results demonstrated that her white cell count was 27,700 cells per cubic millimeter (the normal range: 3,500 to 9,500). The C-reactive protein level was 32.873 mg per deciliter, the blood urea nitrogen level was 20.70 mmol per liter, and the creatinine level was 312.7 μmol per liter. Urinalysis showed an elevated leukocyte count and bacteriuria. A CT scan in horizontal plane sectioning showed that the left kidney was significantly enlarged with thickened perirenal fascia, which was related to the presence of gas in the renal parenchyma and the kidney pelvis (Figure 1). She was transferred to the intensive care unit and treated with meropenem and broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics.

 

 

 

On admission to the ICU (day 0), she was drowsy. Her vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.5°C; pulse rate, 102 beats/min; respiratory rate, 28 breaths/min; blood pressure, 122/54 mmHg (noradrenaline 0.5 microg/kg per min); and pulse oxygen saturation, 98% with high flow oxygen therapy. Diminished breath sounds in the right lower lung were heard on auscultation. There was no audible cardiac murmur. Her abdomen was soft but she failed to cooperate with the abdominal tenderness examination, along with mild pitting edema of both lower limbs. The patient was diagnosed with emphysematous pyelonephritis and septic shock, possibly caused by a gas-producing uropathogenic infection. Unfortunately, according to the RIFLE criteria (2), the patient developed acute renal failure and was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy. However, after active treatment, the clinical effect was remarkable. Her clinical symptoms and serum inflammatory indicators (Figures 2A–C) improved gradually, and she stopped using norepinephrine (day 3). Her renal function (day 3) also recovered (Figures 2D, E), and she was successfully weaned with continuous renal replacement therapy. On the third day, both blood and urine cultures reported extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli. The patients condition continued to improve, and she no longer needed to be treated in the ICU on the 6th day. The patients abdominal CT scan (day 12) revealed that the gas collection in the pelvis and calyces had disappeared. Finally, the patient was discharged. ","Diagnosis:

"Our patient was a 65-year-old male from Vietnam, ED setting. 

He presented with swelling of ankles and pain, redness on right ankle for 7 days and fever, cough, breathlessness from last 1 month.

Two months back he was treated for fever with Ceftriaxone as his Widal test was reactive. At about the same time, he was incidentally diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM). On treatment, though his symptoms subsided to some extent, during last 7 days he again complained of high fever, worsening breathlessness and loss of appetite. He was then brought to our hospital for further management.

On examination he was toxic, febrile, icteric, and dehydrated. Vital signs were body temperature was 102° F, blood pressure 90/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 50/min, and heart rate 128/min. Bronchial breath sounds on left side and bilateral crackles were heard. Spleen was mildly enlarged without any free fluid in the abdomen. No cardiovascular or neurological abnormality was noted. On local examination, ankles were erythematic and oedematous. His right foot had cellulites with pustular discharge. His right knee was also swollen.

Laboratory investigations revealed that multiple hematological and biochemical parameters were deranged [Table 1]. Urine and blood samples were sent for culture.

His chest X-ray showed homogenous consolidation in upper left lobe and diffuse alveolar opacities in remaining part of lung [Figure 1]. Ultra sound revealed mild bilateral pleural effusion and mild ascitis with enlarged spleen. No focal lesions or organomegaly were noted.

Post admission his condition further deteriorated and had clinical evidences of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, deranged blood gases, and was in respiratory distress. His oxygen saturation was 78%. With this background, he was put on ventilator and started with Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Clindamycin.

On day 2, endotracheal secretion was sent for culture. Gram negative bacilli were seen on gram stain. Non fermenting pale colonies with metallic sheen were isolated next day on Blood agar and Mac Conkey agar; the isolate was further processed on Microscan Walkaway 96 Si. Patient was continued with the same antibiotics. His total count, however, further increased to 26,000/cubic mm.

 

 

 

On day 4, the isolate was identified as Burkhlorderia pseudomallei, sensitive to Imipenem, Cotrimoxazole/Sulfamethoxazole, Tetracycline and resistant to Ceftazidime. Later on, both his blood cultures and pus drained from right leg [Figure 4] also grew B. pseudomallei. Based on the sensitivity report, antibiotic was changed to a combination of Imipenem and Doxycycline. Patient showed improvement, his fever subsided, total counts decreased, oxygen saturation was 100%, and was extubated on day 8.

His antibiotics were continued and after complete recovery and improvement of his liver and renal parameters he was discharged on day 20.

" A 58-year-old F patient with a history of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) 9 years ago and recurrent LCH 3 years ago presented with redness and fever around the right eye. 

The patient reported presenting to another hospital with similar complaints 20 days ago, where she was diagnosed with ophthalmic herpes zoster and cellulitis. Subsequently, intravenous treatments with sulbactam-ampicillin (SAM) and acyclovir were initiated. Similar skin lesions developed around the other eye on the sixth day of SAM treatment, and linezolid (LNZ) was added to the treatment. Acyclovir treatment was switched to ganciclovir due to concerns about resistance. The patient, who did not respond to LNZ and SAM, had her treatment revised to include daptomycin (DA) and meropenem (MEM) on the sixth day of LNZ treatment. A skin biopsy on day 20 of her hospitalization was concluded as “diffuse mixed inflammatory cell infiltration rich in perifollicular neutrophils.” 

On physical examination, she exhibited diffuse hyperemia around the right eye and erythematous annular indurated plaques on the right frontal region (Figure 1). Her vital signs were stable. Blood cultures were performed, and initial laboratory studies revealed the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) 107 mg/L, white blood cell (WBC) count 24,500/mm3 [1.8% eosinophil, eosinophil count 400/mm3 (range=0.03-0.27)]. SAM and valacyclovir were initiated. We wondered if the lesions were caused by skin involvement of LCH. A skin biopsy was performed because she did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics at the external center. On the fourth day of treatment, preseptal cellulitis was detected in the magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit, leading to a revision of the treatment plan to include DA and piperacillin-tazobactam. Fluconazole was also started for the fungal infection due to the lack of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The skin biopsy was performed on day 10 of antibiotic therapy and day 6 of antifungal therapy. The biopsy results included findings of an orthokeratotic stratum corneum, focal hypergranulosis, spongiosis, exocytosis, basal vacuolar degeneration, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration, including eosinophils in the dermal layer around the vessels, and on the vessel walls, as well as extravasated erythrocytes. No basal membrane thickening was observed using the histochemical periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain method, and there was no evidence of a slight increase in dermal mucin with alcian blue staining. Immunohistochemical assays for CD14, CD68, and S-100 yielded nonspecific results. These findings were interpreted as consistent with EC (Figure 2). Thereupon, the antimicrobial treatment of the patient was discontinued. The patient was given 40 mg/kg/day of systemic prednisolone for three days. Her lesions were significantly regressed on day 3 of the treatment (Figure 3). She was discharged with full recovery and prescribed a maintenance treatment with oral and topical steroids. The CRP level measured 130 mg/L on the initial day of treatment, and it decreased to 8 mg/L by the 12th day of steroid therapy. A high WBC count (27,100/mm3) was considered to be compatible with the use of steroids. ","Diagnosis:

Eosinophilic Cellulitis

* Probability: Probability: High
* Emergency: Medium
* Rationale: The patients skin biopsy results, which showed mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration including eosinophils and absence of basal membrane thickening, support the diagnosis of eosinophilic cellulitis.

" ED setting, a 25-year old male caucasian patient suffered from an autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder (ALPS) that was treated by splenectomy 24 months before this event. 
He had no previous episodes of severe infections. In March 2014, he developed malaise, chills and abdominal pain of sudden onset after heavy exercise, and contacted his nearest outpatient clinic. A routine check-up involving ECG, chest X-ray, blood pressure measurement and determination of O2-saturation showed no significant abnormalities. Blood results showed slightly elevated leukocyte counts with 11.3 G/L, normal red blood cell counts (4.78 T/L) and normal platelets with 294 G/L (see Table  Table1).1). The patient was sent home after transfusion of 1 L isotonic infusion solution and symptomatic therapy with metamizol and paracetamol.
Eight hours later, the general condition of the patient worsened rapidly and he had to be hospitalized because at that time he had already developed leukopenia (2.8 G/L), his platelet levels were low (108 G/L) and the serum creatinine was elevated (2.0 mg/dl). Hemostasis parameters were also altered (again depicted in Table  Table1).1). A rapid test for S. pneumoniae-antigen was positive and although antimicrobial therapy was started immediately, the patient developed hemodynamic problems (systolic RR: 50 mmHg) and had to be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU). In spite of catecholaminergic therapy, fluid resuscitation and intubation, the organ dysfunction of the patient deteriorated and he developed severe septic shock with metabolic acidosis (lactate 15 mmol/L), anuric renal failure, overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and fast spreading necrotic skin lesions, resembling purpura fulminans.
Thus, the patient received fibrinogen (Haemocomplettan®, CSL Behring) and prothrombincomplex (Beriplex®, CSL Behring) alongside clindamycin, linezolid and intravenous immunoglobulins (Pentaglobin®, Biotest Pharma GmbH) and was transferred to our intensive care unit at the Medical University of Vienna.
Upon admission, his hemodynamic and respiratory situation was stable. The metabolic acidosis, however, worsened: lactate levels increased to 18 mmol/L and signs of hepatic impairment were detectable with elevated transaminases and hypoglycemia. Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) levels were massively increased at 6678 U/L and myoglobin values were at 11,500 ng/mL. The skin lesions progressed, and confluent lesions spread over the whole face, both hands and both feet. Hemostasis parameters showed thrombocytopenia (33 G/L), a PT of 31%, an aPTT of >180 s, fibrinogen values of 72 mg/dl and massively elevated D-Dimer levels (72.19 μg/ml), resembling septic coagulopathy with purpura fulminans. According to local and international recommendations, coagulation therapy with a plasma-derived protein C concentrate (Ceprotin®, Baxalta), was initiated. An initial bolus dose of 100 U/kg body weight was given, followed by 10 U/kg/h, aiming for plasma protein C activity values of 100 U/dL. Additional hemostatic therapy consisted of fibrinogen and platelet concentrates, antithrombin replacement (aiming for antithrombin levels of 100 U/dL), and low dose heparin infusion (250 U/kg BW/h). Moreover, extracorporeal renal replacement therapy had to be started because of acute renal failure.
Table  Table11 summarizes the blood parameters as well as clinical scores from the initial presentation at the outpatient clinic of the peripheral hospital until day 5 upon admission on our intensive care unit.
Under this treatment the patient could be successfully stabilized. Although CK and myoglobin values continued to increase during the next 3 days and the face and the limbs of the patient were impressively hypoperfused, there were no signs for a compartment syndrome, and no surgical intervention was necessary. After peaking at day 3 upon admission, CK values decreased within the next weeks until returning into the normal range after 4 weeks. In parallel, also the hemostaseologic parameters improved and the skin situation ameliorated.
The renal situation, however, remained unchanged and until week 4 no sufficient renal function could be established. Therefore, the patient was changed from continuous hemofiltration to intermittent hemodialysis, which was well tolerated. Creatinine levels were constantly high, peaking with 7.95 mg/dl.
After 27 days, the patient could be transferred from the intensive care unit to our infectiological ward, where he stayed for another 26 days. Within this stay and under forced fluid substitution, his creatinine levels returned almost into normal range (1.27 mg/dl); also the urine output increased, so renal replacement therapy could be stopped after 4 weeks upon admission. In following, renal function returned to normal. The local skin situation improved constantly, necrotic areas were surgically removed and healed decently.
The patient could be finally transferred to a rehabilitation center, from which he was discharged fully recovered. ","Diagnosis:

"A 37-year-old previously healthy M patient presented to the emergency room (ER) with complaints of weakness and fatigue, double vision and photophobia of few hours’ duration. It was not associated with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain or any change in bowel habits. There was no chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or loss of consciousness. No recent medications were started.

The patients’ past medical history (PMH), past surgical history (PSH) and family history (FH) were unremarkable. He was not on regular medications with no allergies and denied any history of smoking.

On examination, the patient was vitally stable and afebrile. His abdominal, respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination was difficult to assess, as patient was very drowsy. However, plantars were down going, and pupils were pinpoint bilaterally. There were no obvious needle marks and lower limb examination was normal.

Laboratory investigations (hematological and biochemical) were all within normal levels. CT Brain was also done at the level of the ER that was unremarkable.

The patient was admitted to the ward with the initial impression of reduced level of consciousness with isolated medical 3rd nerve palsy. Drug overdose was a differential at the time of admission. Drug levels (Acetaminophen), urine toxicology and MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) brain were requested. The patient also received a dose of Naloxone that improved his level of consciousness for a short period of time.

The Neurologist saw the patient the next day in the ward, and examination showed response to painful stimuli. He was vitally stable with neck rigidity and positive Kernig’s sign. The right pupil was constricted whereas the left one was dilated. Plantars were down going bilaterally.

A differential diagnosis of absence seizure, meningitis and possible stroke was made. The patient was kept in isolation and planned for lumbar puncture (LP). He was also scheduled for an electroencephalogram (EEG), MRI brain and Carotid Doppler. After LP was done, he was started on Ceftriaxone 2 g once daily, Vancomycin 1600 mg every 8 hours intravenously and Acyclovir 800 mg every 8 hours intravenously. He was also started on Keppra 1 g twice daily intravenously as a prophylaxis for seizure disorder.

When patient was reviewed the next day, he was fully conscious. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes and calcium, C-reactive protein (CRP), hepatitis profile, Syphilis, HIV, Toxoplasmosis screen, ANA and lipid profile were normal. However, Protein C and S were elevated―>141% and >126% respectively. CSF analysis showed elevated protein level (80 mg/dl). The gram stain showed no organism, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) negative and cultures were negative.

MRI Brain showed acute infarcts in bilateral thalamus, meningeal irritation (Figure 1) and bilateral sinusitis. There were sharp wave discharges in both temporo-occipital regions on his EEG (Figure 2). Carotid Doppler showed no stenosis or atherosclerotic plaques.

Day 3 of his admission, the patient was conscious, alert and oriented. Neck rigidity improved and Kernig’s sign was negative. The patient was kept under observation for one week and was discharged in a good and stable condition.

"A 43 years old M patient, smoker, not known to have any significant medical illness came to our hospital with 2 days history of fever and altered sensorium and no other significant neurological history. The patient did not take COVID-19 vaccine and had no recent travel.

On examination, he was found conscious but confused, not oriented, and not obeying to commands. Pupils were equal and reacting, fundus examination – normal, no focal neurological deficit, and no signs of meningeal irritation. He was mildly febrile, maintaining saturation of 96% on room air. His blood pressure was elevated − 172/109. Chest and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. Blood investigations showed normal WBC and lymphocyte count with normal renal and liver function tests, with negative toxicology screen and negative serology.

Consequently, the patient was admitted as case of acute confusion state. To rule out meningoencephalitis, CT head without contrast was done and was normal. He was tested positive for COVID-19. The patient was started on acyclovir, antibiotics, and steroids. LP done showed normal biochemistry and HSV 1 and 2 serology negative.

The next day, patient’s consciousness level deteriorated and had pupillary asymmetry with dilated and nonreactive right pupil. He was intubated and ventilated. Repeated CT brain showed no newly developed vascular insult during the time interval. Brain MRI with MRA was done and showed posterior circulation (AOP) stroke represented by bilateral medial thalamus and midbrain infarcts (shown in Fig. 1, 2) with nonvisualization of posterior cerebral artery.

"A 64-year-old M patient suffering from rapid onset aphasia and progressive weakness in his right leg was evaluated on July 13, 2003, ED setting

 His neurological examination revealed moderate deterioration in his speech and a mild monoparesis (4/5) in his right leg. His routine laboratory investigation was normal. His computerized tomography (CT) was compatible with the changes attributable to his age, without any signs of an acute process. His medical history was unremarkable except for hypertension and a surgery for knee prosthesis. The diagnosis was transient ischemic attack after rapid improvement in his neurological signs. Further investigation revealed a small plaque in his left internal carotid artery with no hemodynamic alterations and an aneurismal dilatation at the cardiac apex with a suspicious thrombus within. The decision was to follow him up with antiplatelet therapy. Unfortunately 48 Turkish Neurosurgery 2007, Vol: 17, No: 1, 48-54 Börcek: Ischemic Stroke Complicated by a Brain Abscess he presented with alteration in consciousness and right hemiparesis (3/5) on September 23. His radiological and laboratory investigation on admission were again normal. However, his control CT revealed a left occipito-parietal hypodense lesion compatible with left posterior cerebral artery infarction (Figure 1). The patient was hospitalized and given proper treatment. The diagnosis was ischemic stroke. to the lateral margin of the infarct site that was shaped like a ring, showed hyperdensity and was nearly 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2). The lesion was not demonstrating any mass effect and there was no obvious edema around it. The radiological interpretation was not clear because of the doubt whether the lesion was a hematoma in the absorption phase or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not be performed to rule out Figure 1: CT image demonstrating left occipito-parietal hypodense lesion compatible with left posterior cerebral artery infarction. After his discharge with moderate deficits, he was readmitted because of high fever and decreased level of consciousness on December 19, 2003. His body temperature was 39.3 C. His laboratory findings supported an acute infectious process: erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h, C-reactive protein 58 mg/dl, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dl, white blood cell count 18700/mm3 and slight hepatic dysfunction with relevant values. His neurological examination revealed a right hemiparesis that was interpreted as a sequel of his previous stroke, and diminished consciousness. The chest x-ray and urinalysis results were normal. His cranial tomography with contrast medium showed the previous infarct site at the left occipito-parietal region. Additionally, there was another lesion closer Figure 2: Patient’s enhanced CT revealing a ring-like shaped lesion over the previous infarct any of these diagnoses because of his incompatible knee prosthesis. Given the possibility of a brain abscess, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was performed. The opening pressure was 160 mmH2O. The laboratory results were as follows: leukocyte count 2700/mm3 with 96% neutrophils, glucose level 0.3 mmol/L and protein level 5.8 g/L. The gram stain and the culture of the CSF were negative, just like the other samples (urine, sputum and blood). Since the CSF findings were compatible with a central nervous system infection, he was administered high dose, empirical antibiotic therapy (imipenem 6 gr/day). We did not perform a surgery not only because of the patient’s unstable cardiac condition but also because the lesion’s small size allowed us to follow the patient up. The patient improved gradually with antibiotics 49 Turkish Neurosurgery 2007, Vol: 17, No: 1, 48-54 Börcek: Ischemic Stroke Complicated by a Brain Abscess and supportive management.

"We report the case of a 12-year old M patient who was admitted to our institution for sudden onset of right-sided weakness, ED setting

Four days prior to admission he started to have low to moderate grade intermittent fever associated with occasional non-paroxysmal unproductive cough. He was prescribed with Clarithromycin, antihistamine, and β2-agonist medications, with resolution of symptoms. The fever recurred 1 day prior to admission associated with 2 episodes of non projectile vomiting of previously ingested food, and a throbbing frontal mild to moderate headache. About 12 h prior to admission, the patient could no longer move his right upper and lower extremities, prompting transport to the hospital where he had an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures lasting for 10 sec. The past medical history revealed that the patient had a bout of fever and cough about 3 weeks prior to admission, for which he was prescribed Amoxicillin-clavulanic and Salbutamol, with subsequent improvement. In the emergency room, the patient was examined conscious, coherent, oriented to 3 spheres, verbal but unable to move his right upper and lower extremities, and febrile at 38.6°C. The systemic physical examination findings were generally normal. However, the neurologic examination revealed a flattened right nasolabial fold, inability to lift his right shoulder, and deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion. There was 0/5 motor strength of the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski sign present at the right. Hyporeflexia was noted on the right upper and lower extremities. 

Suspected diagnosis: stroke

The patient was initially admitted as childhood stroke, and was worked up along this impression. There was neutrophilia seen in the complete blood count. This, together with the fever prompted administration of antibiotics. Hyponatremia at 127.5 mEq/L was seen. The prothrombin time was prolonged with an activity of 57.4% while the activated partial thromboplastin time was normal. The lipid profile showed low High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). The urinalysis was normal. The chest radiograph and the 2-dimensional echocardiography were normal. The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontal lobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction (Figure 1). The fever resolved on the third day of hospitalization while on the antibiotics, but the motor deficits did not improve. Physical therapy was started. By the sixth day of hospitalization, the patient’s motor strength on the right upper and lower extremity was seen to be 2/5, which further improved to 3/5 the next day. Rehabilitation therapy and the antibiotics were continued. The patient’s condition was progressively improving, when on the 17th hospital day there was note of sudden regression of the motor strength of the affected side to 0/5. Anisocoria was also noted. A re-stroke was considered so a repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed; this time, multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect, consistent with a brain abscess (Figure 2). A neurosurgery referral was made, and a contrast-enhanced brain CT scan was preceded, Figure 1: The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontal lobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction. Figure 4: A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37th hospital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe, surrounding vasogenic edema and expansile effect, right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect.

"A 59-year-old nursing home patient with Down syndrome had high fever unresponsive to paracetamol, and unproductive cough for 4 d, ED setting.

Accordingly, cefriaxone was administered with some improvement (defervescence and reduction of cough). After the reappearance of fever associated with dyspnea, acrocyanosis, and her deteriorating condition, she was brought to the emergency room, and on initial evaluation she was admitted to the internal medicine department of our hospital. She had a ventricular (pacing), ventricular (sensing), inhibition (response) (and) rate-adaptive holder pacemaker because of a third degree atrioventricular block. Furthermore, her past medical history included chronic cerebrovascular disease due to previous ischemic strokes complicated by vascular dementia and epilepsy. The latter was possibly due to Alzheimer-like disease as is often seen in down syndrome patients. On arrival in the internal medicine department the patient was drowsy, tachypneic, tachycardic, low blood pressure (80/50 mmHg) and hypoxemic (PaO2 57 mmHg). The thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of bilateral basal parenchymal opacities. The patient was treated empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin according to protocol for health care-associated pneumonia. An initial bed-side echocardiogram evaluation revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 36%, and dilatation of the right ventricle with medium-apical akinesis. In addition to fluid resuscitation, dopamine, dobutamin, and norepinephrine infusion were administred. At times simultaneous administration of two vaso-active amines was necessary to achieve hemodynamic stabilization and adequate diuresis. The first electrocardiogram showed regular activation of the pacemaker and subsequent evaluations revealed repolarization abnormalities of probable hypoxic nature in the inferior wall only (Figure 1).

This evidence does not rule out an acute ischemic event but could be seen as suggesting Tako-Tsubo syndrome. The differential diagnosis also concerned pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and myocarditis. The former was excluded through execution of CT angiography. In relation to myocardial infarction and myocarditis, it was not possible to perform coronary angiography or a myocardial biopsy. However, the absence of persistent regional abnormalities ruled out acute coronary syndrome. The third transthoracic echocardiogram showed complete remission of the regional abnormalities (E.F. 50%). The patient was discharged after gradual weaning from vaso-active amines in adequate clinical condition. Therefore, our patient had survived, in spite of severe cardiac involvement and possible Tako-Tsubo syndrome. ","Diagnosis:

Tako-Tsubo Syndrome

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with key clinical features suggestive of Tako-Tsubo syndrome: stress-induced cardiomyopathy leading to severe left ventricular dysfunction, repolarization abnormalities, dilatation of the right ventricle with akinesis, and a subsequent improvement in cardiac function. No persistent regional wall motion abnormalities were noted which makes acute coronary syndrome less likely.

Suitable Treatments:
* support therapy"
"53-year-old female with a past medical history of celiac disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department after a sudden onset of right-sided facial and eye swelling. 

She was seen earlier that morning at a local dental office, where she underwent a replacement of a prior filling. Upon presentation, a review of systems was negative except for right-sided blurry vision. She denied headache, nausea, emesis, dyspnea, chest pain, fever, or rash. She had no allergies and received no new medications during the procedure. Vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was remarkable for crepitus of the right lateral neck, mandibular, midface, and periorbital area (Figure 1).

 
 

CT of the soft tissue of the neck and chest was obtained. Imaging revealed extensive pneumomediastinum, the right greater than the left, with an extension into the soft tissues of the neck and adjacent to and within the right orbit without the evidence of pneumothorax, focal inflammation, or abscess.

Figure 1: Multiple CT views showing extensive subcutaneous emphysema

 
 

Oral maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) and thoracic surgery were consulted. OMFS recommended the initiation of prophylactic amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate for a one-week duration along with Peridex rinse twice daily. Thoracic surgery evaluated the patient and agreed with the initiation of prophylactic antibiotics. Neither surgical service recommended surgical intervention. The patient desired to be discharged home with close outpatient follow-up. Return precautions, including worsening swelling, chest pain, dyspnea, and fever, were given to the patient upon discharge.

She was re-evaluated for acute shortness of breath and tachypnea in the emergency department approximately one week after her initial presentation. Her clinical presentation was concerning for pulmonary embolism. Repeat CT of the chest was performed and did not reveal pulmonary embolism but did reveal a vast improvement in subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum from the week prior without any interventions. She was diagnosed with a panic attack and discharged home. ","Diagnosis:

90%

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum can occur due to air escaping into the tissue spaces during dental procedures, particularly when a high-speed drill is used. This condition was confirmed through imaging, which revealed extensive presence of free air.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotic prophylaxis, support therapy"
"A 54-year-old M patietn with 40-pack-year smoking history presented in the ED with chest pain. The pain was sudden in onset, persistent with mid sternum location and radiating to his neck, upper arms and back. 

He had a productive cough with increasing amount of blood tinged sputum and intermittent wheezing over 3 weeks. He also had a pleuritic chest pain with a cough. The patient has known a diagnosis of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II airflow limitation with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 2.56 L, 70% of the predicted value and moderate diffusion impairment. There was no history of recent COPD exacerbation or dyspnoea on exertion. The patient did develop progressive shortness of breath with haemoptysis and noticed to have night sweats. However, there were no other infectious symptoms including fever, rigours, chills or recent weight loss. He denied illicit drug usage, tuberculosis exposure, and recent travel or incarceration. He reported negative HIV and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin testing. His medical history also includes hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

On examination in the emergency department, the patient was afebrile though tachycardiac. 

Vital signs were: Heart rate was 107 bpm, blood pressure 119/68 mm Hg and the respiratory rate was increased to 20 breaths per minute with the oxygen saturation of 96% while breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds at the right lung with mild expiratory wheezing. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe bullae with adjacent opacification and emphysematous lung (figure 1). Additional laboratory workup revealed mild leucocytosis with white blood cell count of 14 400/μL, mild anaemia with haemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL but normal platelet count 268×103/μL. Coagulation profile including prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was within normal limits. Serial troponins were in normal range and the ECG did not reveal acute ST-T changes. Infectious workup including sputum culture and respiratory viral panel was requested. Due to worsening haemoptysis and persistent chest pain, CT of the chest with contrast was performed. The CT chest revealed moderate to severe paraseptal emphysema predominant in the upper lobe. There were non-enhancing soft tissue opacities in paraseptal bullae without air-fluid levels, along with adjacent ground-glass opacities in right upper lobe. Hounsfield unit (HU) of the soft tissue densities was ranging from 50 to 70 consistent with haemorrhage or blood clots. There was no filling defect in the pulmonary arteries and no radiological evidence of endobronchial lesions was observed (figure 2). The patient received empirical antibiotics with azithromycin and ceftriaxone with oral prednisone with the presumed diagnosis of pneumonia and acute COPD exacerbation. Due to worsening haemoptysis on presentation, bronchoscopy was planned. However no recurrent haemoptysis was noticed after the treatment, so airway surveillance was deferred. Further diagnostic workups for invasive fungal infections, mycobacterium disease and vasculitis were performed including acid fast bacilli, serum galactomannan, antineutrophil antibodies (ANA) and antineutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibodies (ANCA), which were all negative. The urine sample for 23 valent pneumococcal antigen was positive, but this was attributed to the 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccaride vaccine administered at hospital admission. The patient improved clinically with no recurrent haemoptysis or chest pain.

Fig 2 CT images of the patient were obtained in February (A1–A3), March (B1–B3) and July 2016 (C1–C3). (A1–A3) Axial sections showing moderate to severe emphysema, primarily paraseptal, with a lesser centrilobular component. There are numerous non-enhancing soft tissue opacities in upper lobe paraseptal bullae. (A2) Confluent ground glass opacities in the adjacent relatively normal lung adjacent to the bullae affected by the described soft tissue opacities. (B1–B3) Axial sections showing a marked improvement of the soft tissue opacities within paraseptal bullae in size and number. The confluent ground glass opacities noted in A2 have near completely resolved. No new or progressive finding. (C1–C3) The soft tissue opacities within paraseptal bullae in A1 and B1 continue to improve. No ground glass opacities, No new or progressive finding.

Subsequent CT scan of the chest 5 weeks after discharge revealed no new pulmonary opacities and prior soft tissue opacities within paraseptal bullae had markedly improved in numbers and sizes (figure 2). Clinically, the patient was asymptomatic with improved dyspnoea, without weight loss or night sweats. He denied a cough or recurrent haemoptysis. Follow-up CT scan 3 months later demonstrated further improvement of the multiple soft tissue opacities within the paraseptal bullae (figure 2). The patient quitted smoking and remained asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up visit.

The patient had ongoing symptoms for 3 weeks with haemoptysis, night sweats and further developed acute chest pain. The initial chest radiograph was consistent with large bullae with adjacent airspace disease supporting the diagnosis of underlying pulmonary infection and exacerbation of COPD. However, with acute chest pain and worsening haemoptysis, vascular involvement including aortic dissection, pulmonary vascular occlusion or possible vasculitis needed to be evaluated. Pneumothorax remained in differentials as well. By CT scan of the chest major vascular involvement and pneumothorax could be excluded. It was further helpful in evaluating the pathogenesis of the numerous soft tissue densities by measuring Hounsfield units, which suggested intrabullous haemorrhage. However, it was initially difficult to exclude the presence of concurrent invasive fungal disease, mycobacterial infection or inflammatory processes including vasculitis. The unilateral location of cystic lesions filled with the pretentious material as observed in our patient is not characteristic of a vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA: formerly called Wegener’s granulomatosis) which usually occurs bilaterally.  ","Diagnosis:

Acute COPD Exacerbation with Infection

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Medium
* Rationale: The patient has known COPD (GOLD stage II), and the presentation includes cough, increased sputum production, and wheezing along with findings on the chest radiograph and CT scan. The positive urine pneumococcal antigen also supports an infectious process, consistent with pneumonia.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotic, support therapy"
" A 33 year old female presented to the ED for oral and maxillofacial surgical review after developing painful right-sided cheek and neck swelling after a dental extraction earlier that day. 

After a failed endodontic treatment on her 46, the decision was made to extract it. Due to the prolonged time and difficulty extracting it with forceps, an air-turbine high-speed dental drill was used as an emergency measure to section the tooth and remove it.

The patient denied other medical conditions or regular medication use. On examination, she had slight right-sided cheek swelling extending down her neck to her clavicle, with surrounding erythema. Vital signs were within normal limits and she was afebrile. On palpation, crepitus was felt over her neck and upper chest wall.

Head, neck and chest plain film X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema within her neck, without spread to the mediastinum (Fig. 1). Orthopantomogram confirmed a recently extracted 46 (Fig. 2). Chest X-ray showed no free air in the mediastinum (Fig. 3). Blood tests showed a mildly elevated white cell count of 10.

The patient was admitted for close observation, analgesia and prophylactic I.V. antibiotics (amoxicillin and metronidazole). Her pain and swelling slowly improved and she was discharged after 2 nights. ","Diagnosis:

Subcutaneous Emphysema

* Probability:High Probability
* Emergency: Moderate-High. Immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further complications, though surgical intervention is typically not required if there’s no mediastinal involvement.
* Rationale: The crepitus on palpation, swelling, and erythema coupled with the use of an air-turbine high-speed dental drill are highly suggestive of subcutaneous emphysema. This occurs when air gets trapped in the subcutaneous tissue, often following dental procedures.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotics, support therapy"
" A 62-year-old female patient presented to the ED with a painless cervicofacial swelling that had reportedly developed progressively over the past 4 hours. 

The patient had undergone extraction of a first premolar 7 days ago, during which bone damage of the mandibular jaw had been noted. A postextraction inspection of the alveolar ridge had been performed, under local anaesthesia, an hour before the swelling onset. The operating dentist reported using an air syringe, in an attempt to dry the extraction socket and inspect a lesion on the alveolar ridge. The patient complained of mild dysphagia without any other symptom.

Swelling of the right half of the patient’s face, including the maxillary and periorbital region, was noted (figure 1A). The swelling extended to the patient’s right neck, down to the supraclavicular fossa. Palpation of the affected areas elicited crepitus. During oral inspection, the first premolar extraction site was recognised. Mild oedema of the floor of the mouth was also noted. Rhinopharyngolaryngoscopy with flexible fiberscope showed no oedema or protrusion of the pharyngeal walls.

Head, neck, and chest CT scans were performed and demonstrated air trapped subcutaneously in the right face, from the orbital soft tissue spaces to the right neck, extending also to the prevertebral space (figures 1B and 2A). The emphysema extended lower to the anterior mediastinum (figure 2B,C).

The patient was admitted for observation and received intravenous amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and metronidazole. The patient’s stay was uneventful and she was discharged, with oral antibiotics, 2 days later. A week later, during follow-up examination, she was asymptomatic and the emphysema had clinically resolved completely. Follow-up CT scan, after 2 weeks, showed no noticeable emphysema.

Cervicofacial subcutaneous emphysema (CSE) consists of abnormal presence of air in the soft tissues of the head and neck. Rarely, it can occur as a potentially serious complication of dental and oral surgical procedures. The use of high-pressure air instruments in dentistry as well as air syringes during root canal therapy has repeatedly been demonstrated as the cause of cervicofacial emphysema. However, the use of these instruments in a post extraction socket is not common and CSE is, thus, rare following such procedures. In our case, a possible mechanism would also involve the previously mentioned alveolar bone lesion. Therefore, the physician should be aware of this risk before any procedure requiring the use of such instruments and should take appropriate measures to minimise this complication.

Crepitus is a pathognomonic sign of CSE. Therefore, it should be recognised by every physician performing invasive or surgical procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract. CSE should always be considered when a patient develops a facial or neck swelling following such a procedure. It can occur either immediately after the procedure or several hours later.

CSE is usually a self-limited condition and does not require any special treatment. However, potential life-threatening complications can occur. Neck spaces communicate through fascial planes with each other and with the mediastinum. Air accumulation can lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumopericardium development. Dissemination of oral micro-organisms can cause neck or mediastinal infections. Air embolism has also been reported in the literature. Therefore, close monitoring is necessary in these cases, until the emphysema has resolved.

" A 41-year-old female was admitted to the Neurology Department at our hospital because of recurrent headaches, ED setting.

The attacks have begun many years ago, occurring 3–5 times per month and persisted for 2–3 days. The headaches were mostly left-sided with symptoms occasionally presenting on the opposite side. Almost each episode was accompanied with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Additionally, there were associated facial paresthesias ipsilateral to the headache. The episodes were triggered and worsened by physical exertion. Neurological examination was normal and the patient denied additional symptoms. To exclude cerebral pathologies the decision to perform computed tomography angiography (CTA) was made.

The examination was performed on a 64-row CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT GE Healthcare). Raw data was reconstructed and assessed using Advantage Window 4.6 dedicated console. During native scanning, the region of the skull base was scanned with collimation of 2.5 mm (140 kV, 335 mA) and remaining structures of the brain were scanned with collimation of 5 mm (120 kV, 320 mA). CTA examination of the brain was performed with 80 mL of intravenously administered non-ionic contrast (370 mgJ/mL), infused at a rate of 4 mL/s. Delay time was determined with Smart Prep technique and scanning parameters included collimation of 0.625 mm, 120 kV, and 330 mA, tube rotation time 0.5 s.

Native scanning revealed an ischaemic lesion in the peri-insular region of the left temporal lobe (Fig. 1).

Uhlig_01.tif

Figure 1. A. Axial scan presenting ischaemic lesion in left temporal lobe indicated with arrow; B. Area in the neighbourhood of ischaemic lesion (bordered with red dashed line) is enlarged and vascular territories are marked with colours: orange — medial cerebral artery (MCA), cyan — anterior cerebral artery (ACA), yellow — posterior cerebral artery (PCA), green — medial lenticulostriate arteries (M LSA) (ACA branches), navy blue — lateral lenticulostriate arteries (L LSA) (MCA branches), red — anterior choroidal arteries (AChA).

In CTA series a left-sided persistent trigeminal artery was found (Fig. 2).

Circle of Willis in volume rendering with bone extraction option; VA — vertebral arteries (left and right); BA — basal artery; LICA — left internal carotid artery; PCAs — posterior cerebral arteries; ACAs — anterior cerebral arteries; MCA — middle cerebral arteries (left and right). Trigeminal artery indicated with yellow arrow.

The vessel originated from the C4 section of the internal carotid artery where its diameter was 3.4 mm. It took a posterolateral course, encircling the dorsum sella. Distal to this, it coursed towards the petrous part of the temporal bone, where it penetrated into its apex. It continued medially merging eventually with the upper part of the basal artery just below superior cerebellar arteries. The diameter at the distal end of the PTA was 2.1 mm and its total length was 27 mm. The caudal portion of basal artery was hypoplastic. Morphology and course of the PTA is an example of a Saltzman type I and according to the Salas classification it corresponded to the lateral variation.

Additionally, the right A1 segment was hypoplastic while the right posterior communicating artery and anterior communicating artery were well developed. The left posterior communicating artery was not visible in CTA examination.

Based on CTA examination and clinical symptoms, migraine-like headache due to PTA was diagnosed and the decision to treat conservatively was made. Currently, the patient is treated with iprazochrome (2.5 mg) 3 times per day. During treatment the headaches appear only 1–2 times per month and are less intense. ","Diagnosis:

Migraine-like Headache due to Persistent Trigeminal Artery

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The patient exhibits classic migraine symptoms (unilateral headache, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting) alongside an ischemic lesion in the left temporal lobe and a structural vascular anomaly (PTA) detected on CTA.

* iprazochrome (2.5 mg) 3 times per day"
" We present the case of a 28-year-old man who had no significant previous medical history. He presented at the ED with lesions in the skin on lower limbs and trunk that did not disappear when pressed by a finger. 

 

The patient had no other systemic symptoms. He did not have fever or signs of infection anywhere else, except certain genital symptoms that were not well defined. He denied the use of drugs, sexual risk behavior and the consumption of any type of medication. He had arthralgia but not arthritis and, on the level of the skin, he had flat, erythematous, nonpruritic lesions, together with other bullous lesions (Fig. 1). He underwent a skin biopsy which revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis (perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with predominance of neutrophils, and nuclear dust, fibrinoid degeneration and extravasated red blood cells; subepidermal blisters with hemorrhagic and pustular content and focal epidermal necrosis). The analytical study, which involved acute-phase reactants, complete blood count and biochemical and immunological data, was normal. A urine culture was negative, as were serological tests for the hepatotropic viruses. Colonies of Ureaplasma urealyticum were identified in the urethral exudate. At admission, treatment was begun with prednisone (30mg/day) and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen at 600mg every 8h). This was followed by clinical improvement; however, it did not persist until antibiotic therapy was initiated with doxycycline, in accordance with antibiogram indications for Ureaplasma. Steroids were discontinued after 1 month and, 6 months later, the patient was asymptomatic without treatment.

" A 51-year-old man with no past medical history presented to the ED with a 1-day history of diffuse maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and epigastric abdominal pain.
 The patient was a truck driver and former tobacco user (2 packs of cigarettes/day). He denied new medications or international travel prior to the development of symptoms. A physical exam noted a rash on the bilateral upper and lower extremities, and the patient reported lower extremity pain. Bilateral lower extremity duplex ultrasounds revealed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower extremity, which was treated with a heparin drip and then transitioned to apixaban twice daily. To address the rash, the patient received a single dose of methylprednisolone 125 mgintravenously (IV). Following treatment, the patient reported improvement in symptoms and was discharged.
The patient returned to the emergency room 6 days later, reporting worsening of the rash, joint pains (now with intermittent swelling of his elbows, knees, and wrists), and worsening epigastric pain. The patient reported that the rash now covered his torso and had spread to his back. It was nonpruritic. He reported epigastric pain, which was aggravated with eating, the onset of which coincided with the onset of the rash. He also noted mild’ diarrhea, with two episodes of dark stools since the onset of symptoms. He denied hematuria.
In the emergency department, the patient vital signs was hypertensive at 150/94 mmHg, tachycardic at 113 beats per minute, and afebrile. Physical examination was notable for numerous scattered, non-blanching purpuric papules and macules ranging from bright pink to violaceous in color on the abdomen, flanks, lower back, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Figure 1). Scaly, erythematous plaques with scattered excoriations with blood crusting encircling the right lower leg were also noted. Labs on admission were significant for leukocytosis (white blood cell count 14.04×103 cells/µL), hyponatremia (sodium 134 mmol/L), elevated C-reactive protein at 129.4 mg/L, mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen at 26 mg/dL (lab reference range, 8–21 mg/dL), serum creatinine at 0.74 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >90 as reported by our lab. Urinalysis noted proteinuria, 50 mg/dL, and 12 red blood cells per high power field in the sample. In addition, the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast, which was notable for mucosal wall thickening and fatty deposition within the distal ileum. The patient was admitted for further workup, with rheumatology and dermatology consulted due to concern about vasculitis.
Dermatology performed a punch biopsy of the rash and pathology demonstrated perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate and damage to vessel walls with hemorrhage and mild leukocytoclasia consistent with IgA vasculitis (Figure 2). Direct immunofluorescence showed predominant IgA deposition, as well as C3, and fibrin in the papillary vessel walls. Rheumatology evaluated the patient, and he was started on methylprednisolone 48 mg IV. Screening tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), complement levels, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers, and cryoglobulin were all negative. The urine protein/creatinine ratio was within normal limits. Serum IgA and other immunoglobulins were not measured. The patient’s normal creatinine and GFR levels, coupled with minimal proteinuria and hematuria, provided reassurance that renal involvement was mild. Given these findings and the confirmed diagnosis of IgA vasculitis through a skin biopsy, the decision was made to forego a renal biopsy.
The patient reported subjective improvement in rash and joint pains with the administration of methylprednisolone; however, abdominal upset persisted, and the patient had an episode of bright red blood per rectum. The patient was started on a proton pump inhibitor, and gastroenterology was consulted. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, which demonstrated significant necrosis in the terminal ileum with a clear transition of friable inflamed mucosa and unremarkable colonic mucosa. There were also multiple non-bleeding ulcers in the duodenum. These findings are consistent with small-vessel vasculitis involving the GI tract. The patient underwent workup for infectious GI etiologies, including stool culture, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium/Giardia antigen testing, with Cryptosporidium/Giardia returning with a positive result for both. Further speciation of Cryptosporidium and Giardia was not obtained.
The patient continued to improve and was discharged on a prednisone taper to be completed over 6 weeks starting at 60 mg daily. He was recommended to follow up with GI, dermatology, rheumatology, and nephrology. At subsequent rheumatology appointment one month after discharge, he denied any return of symptoms and creatinine and GFR remained within normal range.
In addition, numerous case reports have identified various preceding infections as potential triggers for IgA vasculitis [7,9–11]. These infectious agents encompass a wide array of microbes, including group A Streptococcus, human parvovirus, and Giardia, which are commonly associated with bacterial, viral, and protozoal infections, respectively [7]. They are typically pathogens associated with respiratory or GI infections [7,10]. One aspect to consider is the abundant production of IgA in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), making the digestive tract a significant source of IgA antibodies. A hypothesis suggesting that a dysregulation of the digestive lymphoid organs, possibly incited by the activation of the innate immune response of the digestive mucous membranes due to microorganisms, might play a pivotal role in the development of IgA vasculitis. This hypothesis was suggested in a review of IgA vasculitis authored by Pillebout and Sunderkötter. This hypothesis highlights the significance of exploring GI infections and pathogens as potential contributors to IgA vasculitis [10].
In addition to our patient’s presentation of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infection as a potential trigger for his vasculitis, he interestingly exhibited DVT. Notably, the patient, being a truck driver, had immobility as a known risk factor. However, the initial visit to the emergency room was prompted by a lower extremity purpuric rash, and incidentally, a DVT in the right tibial vein was discovered during the evaluation. Although thromboses are rare complications of IgA vasculitis, evidence suggests a potential link between IgA vasculitis and a prothrombotic process in genetically susceptible adults [18]. Several case reports in adults have documented the development of thromboses after developing IgA vasculitis [19–21]. This has also been observed in children as well, indicating a link between prothrombic states and IgA vasculitis [22]. These instances highlight the possibility of thrombotic events occurring in conjunction with IgA vasculitis, and further investigation is warranted to understand this association better.
Finally, most cases of IgA vasculitis are self-limited and resolve without intervention [23]. Treatment is typically supportive and includes acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as naproxen for arthralgias. It was previously thought that a course of corticosteroids could be used to prevent renal complications; however, a 2015 Cochrane review concluded that there was not enough evidence to support that theory [24]. The decision to treat our patient with a corticosteroid taper was based on the severity of his polyarthralgia, persistent abdominal pain, and diffuse rash. He noted rapid improvement in rash and arthralgias while abdominal pain was slower to respond. ","Diagnosis:

IgA Vasculitis

"37-year-old male with no prior history of headaches presented with a 2-week history of severe right-sided headaches behind the eye, ED setting.
 The patient also reported a previous episode of blurry vision in his left eye a week before the onset of right-sided headache. During this time the patient was fasting for religious reasons and stated that the headache was accompanied with vomiting without nausea which subsided after a meal. The patient stated that he had recently traveled to India for a conference a month prior to the onset of his symptoms, but did not visit any rural areas or get ill during his visit. He did not report any previous episodes.
On examination, his vital signs were normal and he appeared mildly anxious. Upon central nervous system (CNS) examination, pupils were equal, round and reactive to light, cranial nerves II–XII were intact, reflexes were symmetric and intact bilaterally, Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, and no meningeal signs or photophobia.
The initial diagnosis of migraines secondary to hypoglycemia while fasting was made. The patient was requested to discontinue fasting until his symptoms resolved along with 50 mg of Cambia. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for 1 week.
The patient’s symptoms worsened and presented to the emergency room (ER) the following day with sudden onset of dysstasia, aphasia, with right-sided hemiparesis and fluctuating loss of consciousness (LOC). He reported intermittent headaches, generally worse in the back of the head and right-sided blurriness. He did not have any neck stiffness or back pain. The patient reported that he was asymptomatic in the morning but noted unsteady gait, and staring spells as the day progressed. He then began to have worsening dysphasia and dysarthria; however, he was able to follow commands and instructions.
Given the severity of his symptoms, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Initially, he was empirically managed with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 2 g Q12, vancomycin 1 g Q12, and acyclovir 800 mg Q6 for suspected viral encephalitis. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the head and neck showed no acute intracranial abnormality. The patient’s CT was non-diagnostic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed no acute intracranial abnormalities.
Traumatic LP revealed an opening pressure of 35, protein 2.89 g/L, white blood cell (WBC) 133 (106/L) with 53% lymphocytes, red blood cell (RBC) 38,000 (106/L). However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed no evidence of Japanese encephalitis, HSV (type 1 or 2), varicella-zoster virus, enterovirus, or parechovirus. Serum tests for HIV, West-Nile virus PCR, Ebstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and viral hepatitis (A, B, and C) also yielded non-diagnostic results.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in a confused patient during wakefulness and drowsiness. There was mild to moderate diffuse slowing of the background which appeared nonspecific secondary to a mild encephalopathic process. In addition, there was a continuous delta slowing over the left hemisphere through the recording that could be due to structural lesions or postictal changes. There were no definite epileptiform discharges, electrographic seizures, or evidence of non-convulsive status epilepticus.
The patient received 10 days of IV acyclovir which showed improvement in the repeat LP; protein 0.67 g/L, WBC 28 (106/L) with 94% lymphocytes, RBC 73 (106/L) with negative CSF infectious workup. Antibody screening was conducted and ruled out autoimmune encephalitis.
Ten days after admission, he was discharged with 10 days of valacyclovir 500 mg twice a day (BID) for a total of a 20-day course of anti-viral. The patient presented to the outpatient clinic after concluding the valacyclovir. Neurological examination was within normal limits (WNLs) and the patient had complete resolution of viral encephalitis. Figure 1 describes the timeline for the sequence of events in chronological order. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this manuscript.
Patients with headaches are frequent occurrences in primary care practices. The headaches have an estimated lifetime prevalence of 66%—of which, 14% to 16% corresponds to migraine, 46% to 78% to tension-type headache, and 0.1% to 0.3% for cluster headache (1-3). The economic effects of a headache are also substantial. It is estimated that headache accounts for 20% of work absences (4). Majority of these headaches are managed in an outpatient setting without an immediate referral to the emergency department or non-emergent referral to the neurologist. These headaches can be caused by psychosocial factors, prescription medications, or other neurological conditions like migraines. Effective management of these headaches heavily depends on the physician’s ability to assess and diagnose. A detailed and focused history, along with a complete physical examination is essential to identify any causes of headaches. Early detection and diagnosis from the presenting illness allow creating an effective management plan.

"A 38-year-old male with class III obesity and alcohol use disorder presented with cramping abdominal pain, vomiting and dark stool, ED setting.
 There was no recent hospitalization and no antibiotic or intravenous drug use. Last alcoholic drink was reported to be several days prior to presentation. Physical exam identified scleral icterus, abdominal distension without tenderness, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory test results are outlined in Table 1. Serum acetaminophen and alcohol levels were not detected. Urinalysis and chest x-ray were unremarkable. Ultrasound demonstrated cirrhotic liver morphology and ascites, but no cholelithiasis. Ceftriaxone was started due to concerns for an upper gastrointestinal bleed. On day 2, he developed watery diarrhea. Stool cultures were positive for P. aeruginosa, prompting antibiotic transition to cefepime. Clostridioides difficile testing was negative. He completed a five-day course of cefepime with resolution of diarrhea and leukocytosis. Subsequently, he was started on methylprednisolone for treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, and later discharged on a tapering dose. Eleven days later, he returned with vomiting and generalized weakness, and was admitted to the intensive care unit with pansusceptible P. aeruginosa bacteremia and septic shock. Unfortunately, clinical condition continued to deteriorate despite maximal medical therapy, and it ultimately expired.
 
 
P. aeruginosa has rarely been described in association with colitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of P. aeruginosa colitis in a patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, and the first case of P. aeruginosa bacteremia after previously treated colitis. While the optimal duration of treatment for P. aeruginosa colitis is not well defined, this case supports extended antibiotic courses for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections in decompensated cirrhosis and cautious post-treatment steroid utilization.

Alcoholic Hepatitis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder and presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, dark stool, scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, and cirrhosis on ultrasound. These are hallmark signs of alcoholic liver disease, and the development of jaundice and hepatomegaly indicates an ongoing liver inflammation or alcoholic hepatitis.

"a 12-year-old girl, presented in ED with abdominal pain, joint pain, pain in the right thigh and back, and diarrhea existing for 8 days. 

After 4 days the abdominal pain was diminished, but a fever developed (39°C) with shivers. On admittance she was sick and collapsed several times when sitting up right. The heart sounds were normal and no murmurs or pericardial friction were heard. Her abdomen was tender and distended with minimal bowel movement. Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 27.1 × 109/l and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 41 mm in the first hour. On abdominal radiograph there were signs of bowel obstruction and a chest radiograph revealed pleural effusion and probably an infiltrative process. The abdominal sonography was normal. She was started on ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/d) for a suspected pneumonia that same day. A control chest radiograph showed pleural effusion and also an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Blood cultures became positive with Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus milleri. Metronidazole was added. She continued having fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and remained tachypneic. On echocardiographic examination progressive pericardial effusion was seen. The decision was then made to insert a pericardial drain percutaneously, which produced 600 mL serosanguinolent fluid, and she improved clinically. Culture of the pericardial fluid showed Escherichia coli, Viridans streptococci, and Candida albicans, but no anaerobes were detected. Antibiotic treatment was switched to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and fluconazole. Moreover dexamethasone was started. After 4 days the drain was removed, but the same day the pericardial fluid returned again. She was transferred to our university hospital. On echocardiography a pneumo-hydropericard was seen without signs of a cardiac tamponade. A chest and abdominal computed tomogram (CT) scan confirmed the pneumo-hydropericard and demonstrated an abscess in the right lung (Figure 1) and a process in the right abdomen suggesting a psoas abscess (Figure 2). Our hypothesis was that the clinical signs could be attributed to a retrocecal perforated appendix, followed by abdominal and pericardial effusion. No acute abdominal operation seemed indicated at that time. Corticosteroids were tapered down and stopped. Because of a developing septicemia with increasing abdominal pain she was operated 12 days later. We performed an appendectomy and surgically drained the abdominal abscess. Pathologic examination demonstrated severe active peri-appendicitis.

Fig 2Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomogram from patient 1 showing a process in the lower right abdomen suggesting a psoas abscess.

 

Abdominal cultures showed aerobic gram-negative rods, anaerobic positive cocci, and enterococci. She continued receiving amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and recovered quickly after the surgery. Nine days later she collapsed when getting upright. A new echocardiogram showed a markedly thickened pericardium with little pericardial effusion. The inferior caval vein and the hepatic veins were dilated with low flow velocities. There was antegrade pulmonary blood flow in diastole during atrial contraction with a maximal velocity (Vmax) of 0.39 m/s (0.50 m/s in systole) not seen before. Apparently, in a short period of time, the right ventricle has developed a resistance to filling thereby acting as a conduit between right atrium and pulmonary artery. The most logical explanation for this patient is the development of constrictive pericarditis. Because of the hemodynamic unstable situation emergency cardiac surgery was deemed necessary. Partial pericardial resection and decortication of the epicard was performed through a median sternotomy. No cultures were taken at this time. Her further recovery was uneventful and she was discharged home 1 month later. ","Diagnosis:

Perforated Appendicitis with Secondary Peritonitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The persistent abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, distention, and later development of an abscess in the right lower abdomen are consistent with a perforated appendix. The clinical signs and laboratory findings (high WBC count and elevated ESR) further support this diagnosis, along with the findings on the CT scan.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotics, surgery"
"a 13-year-old girl without medical history, presented in Edwith epigastric discomfort for one day (note: this patient was seen and treated 25 years ago).

 Later this pain was more localized in the right lower quadrant. She was nauseated and vomited during the night. She had no diarrhea. Palpation of the abdomen disclosed localized tenderness and rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Her temperature was 37.7°C, her white blood cell count 11.5 × 109, and she had an ESR of 17 mm in the first hour. Appendicitis was diagnosed and an appendectomy was performed. During surgery the appendix perforated. The appendiceal stump was inverted and tied with a purse string. A faecolith was found in the appendix. Antibiotic treatment was started with amoxicillin, but after 1 day treatment was switched to methicillin for 5 days. A persisting fever developed and abdominal sonography revealed multiple intraabdominal abscesses. Pus evacuation through her vagina occurred and culture showed Escherichia coli, anaerobic rods (Bacteroides vulgatus), and Peptostreptococcus species. A relaparotomy was performed after 11 days and a Douglas abscess was evacuated. Antibiotic treatment was changed to doxycycline and metronidazole. After the second surgical intervention she recovered, but slowly. On physical examination a systolic and diastolic murmur was found with crepitations and ascites was also present. The liver could be palpated and a chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged heart contour with low voltage changes on an electrocardiogram. Pericarditis was suspected and furosemide treatment was started. However she did not improve and became septic. Echocardiography showed a purulent pericarditis and an abdominal sonography demonstrated a subphrenic abscess and a Douglas abscess.

The cardiac surgeon performed a partial pericardectomy 25 days after the appendectomy through an anterolateral left thoracotomy. The pericardium and left pleural space were drained and cultures remained negative. This was followed by relaparotomy to evacuate all abscesses. Antibiotics were switched to flucloxacillin, gentamicine, and lincomycin. Three days later a relaparotomy was necessary due to a postoperative cecum perforation. A small bowel resection was necessary (20 cm) and a split ileostomy was made. Several abscesses were drained. After a slow recovery 2 months later the ileostomy was closed. Seven years later she had surgery for a small bowel obstruction with strangulation. Many adhesions were removed and two small bowel resections (50 cm) were necessary. Nine years later she experienced a period of passage problems which resolved spontaneously. Now 25 years later she has one healthy child and is again pregnant by in vitro fertilization. ","Diagnosis:

Intraabdominal Abscesses

* Probability: High, given the history and imaging findings.
* Emergency: High, due to the risk of sepsis and complications.
* Rationale: Initial treatment of perforated appendicitis with subsequent intraabdominal abscesses as demonstrated by imaging and clinical findings.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotics, surgery"
"The F patient, 56 years old presented herself in ED with drowsiness, dizziness, cognitive impairment and severe recurrent episodic headaches. 

Symptoms had started two days earlier. She had previously been admitted to the same hospital for cholangitis and chronic lumbar syndrome exacerbated by opioid addiction. On that occasion, pain therapy had been modified to switch from oxycodone and morphine to buprenorphine; she had also been prescribed duloxetine prior to discharge. Results and course Patient in good cardiopulmonary compensation; Neurological state in the normae; Elevated systolic blood pressure (170 mmHg) with unknown hypertension. Since the patient had reported being treated concomitantly with oxycodone, morphine and buprenorphine, the symptoms were initially interpreted as the result of opioid intoxication. One day after hospitalization, the dizziness had disappeared. However, for two days there were also severe headaches, with a duration of about 3-4 hours, which did not respond to analgesics (paracetamol and metamizole, in addition to the aforementioned opiates). According to the authors, the headache was different from the well-known migraine with aura. The woman had also reported taking rizatriptan for several days. Cerebral CT to rule out an intracranial hemorrhage had not yielded significant results. During the stay the patient again developed fluctuating neurological deficits including a perceptual disorder of the left side of the body, a loss of tone of the extremities on the left side, intermittent and rotational dizziness, and cognitive slowdown. The suspected initial diagnoses were: dissociative disorder or new migraine with aura. Further analysis showed: Cerebral MRI: recent but already delimited cerebral ischemia in multiple areas of flow; presence of two short-extension stenosis in the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and one short-extension stenosis in the posterior cerebral artery. Echodoppler: Mild atheromatosis of the extracranial vessels supplying the brain and several segmental accelerations of intracranial flow in the right ACA, the middle cerebral artery on both sides and the ACA on both sides. Results of CSF and serological screening for vasculitis: not significant. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography: no evidence of cardiac-derived embolism. Final diagnosis and discussion According to the authors, the symptoms were compatible with RCVS, taking into account the absence of enhancement of the wall of the basal cerebral arteries on MRI with black blood sequences with contrast medium. Approximately three weeks later, this diagnostic suspicion was confirmed as the diffuse acceleration of the segmental intracerebral flow initially present in a transcranial echoDoppler was almost completely regressed on both sides. RCVS is a rare but still plausible cause of stroke; it must be clarified immediately to reduce the morbidity and mortality of those affected and to avoid unnecessary or dangerous treatments, the authors point out. Initially, about 10% of patients have transient focal neurological deficits. Visual impairments are the most common followed least frequently by sensory, dysphasic or motor deficits. Physical examination is normal in most cases or shows various fluctuating symptoms. Women are affected more frequently than men. In addition to transient focal neurological deficits, early complications of RCVS include pressure and epileptic seizures; other complications include ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most important differential diagnosis is primary central nervous system vasculitis (PACNS). In this case, unlike RCVS, men are more frequently affected; headache is more insidious and continuous, without associated substance use or monophasic progression. Cognitive deficits are typical, such as confusion and a slow development of dementia. CSF results are generally pathological with lymphomonocyte pleocytosis (usually < 20, rarely > 100 cells) and elevated total protein (usually < 120 mg/dl). Magnetic resonance imaging shows diffuse lesions of the gray and white matter of different ages; hemorrhages are a rarity in PACNS. Angiography is not able to differentiate the two diseases, but the angiographic normalization of the results after intra-arterial administration of nimodipine is indicative of the RCVS ","Diagnosis:

Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The combination of severe headache, fluctuating neurological deficits, recent cerebral ischemia, and the initial finding of stenoses in cerebral arteries strongly suggests RCVS. The diagnosis is further supported by the regression of intracerebral flow abnormalities on follow-up imaging.

Suitable Treatments:
* intra-arterial nimodipine"
" A 21-year-old woman, with no probable previous ones, showed up in the ED with a worsening of her general condition, severe shortness of breath, dizziness and bilateral paresthesias at the extremities.

 The patient stated that she had occasionally consumed nitrous oxide in recent years, but in the four months prior to the symptomatic onset she had consumed increasing amounts of it. In the 5 weeks prior to the emergency room visit, he had consumed 3600 to 7200 grams per day (6 to 12 cylinders of nitrous oxide, about 600 g of nitrous oxide per cylinder). According to the authors, this amount corresponds to a daily anesthesia with nitrous oxide of about 10-20 hours (with 50% nitrous oxide and a respiratory volume/minute of 6 L). The patient did not smoke, had no history of thrombosis and had been taking oral contraceptives for several years. The first results The first results showed: Absence of focal neurological deficits; Tachycardia (130 beats/min); Need for oxygen (6 liters); Systolic blood pressure between 90 and 110 mmHg. Among the initial differential diagnoses, doctors list: pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and a previously undiagnosed tumor.

From subsequent exams: Electrocardiography: signs of overload of the right ventricle; Computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries: cavalry pulmonary embolism (PE) with signs of overload of the right ventricle (the cavalry EP occurs when a large thrombus settles at the point where the main pulmonary artery branches off in the shape of a Y-shape and out of each lung). Laboratory tests also show increased values of: Troponin T, 50 ng/L (reference value <15 ng/L); Type B natriuretic propeptide (pro-BNP) 4600 ng/L (reference value <300 ng/L); Homocysteine, 78 mmol/L (reference value <15 mmol/L); Vitamin B12, 500 pmol/L (within the reference range). Progression and further results On the second day of hospitalization, the patient continued to be confused and weak. The neurological conditions had worsened and a subsequent CT of the brain (on the third day of hospitalization) revealed a recent central central cerebral infarction. An echocardiogram showed a dilated right ventricle with a thrombus in the right ventricle and a right-to-left shunt at the atrial level. Brain MRI on day 4 revealed a thrombosis of the basilar artery and confirmed the presence of extensive ischemic infarctions of the left hemisphere. According to the authors, laboratory tests for coagulation disorders and thrombophilia have been performed several times. Overall, the tests did not reveal the presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies and IgG, IgM or IgA type beta-2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies. Anticoagulant lupus tested negative, as did tests for hereditary thrombophilia. A genetic analysis of the polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) revealed a homozygosis for the MTHFR 1286 A>C variant, which can lead to slightly elevated homocysteine levels. Other possible causes of thrombosis, such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, have been considered but excluded. Several radiological and blood tests have also made it possible to rule out a malignant pathology. Therapy and subsequent course The patient was initially treated with low molecular weight heparin and oral vitamin B12 and hospitalized in preparation for thrombolysis. However, due to the identification of cerebral infarction, thrombolysis was considered contraindicated. The thrombus was then removed mechanically (pulmonary endovascular thrombectomy). The patient continued to receive heparin infusions and in the meantime additional thrombosis was detected in the left and right leg and the iliac artery (right), to which was added a diagnosis of a spleen and kidney infarction. Basic artery thrombosis detected on resonance was also treated with an intracranial endovascular thrombectomy. The patients condition gradually improved even though she was forced into a wheelchair with dysphagia and paresis of the peripheral nerves. After 14 days of stay she was transferred to a neurorehabilitation centre. ","Diagnosis:

Pulmonary Embolism

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: Cavalry PE with signs of right heart strain on CT pulmonary angiography present with worsening dyspnea, dizziness, and bilateral paresthesias, history of nitrous oxide use increases risk of PE

"Our patient was a 65-year-old male from Vietnam . He presented with swelling of ankles and pain, redness on right ankle for 7 days and fever, cough, breathlessness from last 1 month.
Two months back he was treated for fever with Ceftriaxone as his Widal test was reactive. At about the same time, he was incidentally diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM). On treatment, though his symptoms subsided to some extent, during last 7 days he again complained of high fever, worsening breathlessness and loss of appetite. He was then brought to our hospital for further management.
On examination he was toxic, febrile, icteric, and dehydrated. His body temperature was 102° F, blood pressure 90/70mm Hg, respiratory rate 50/min, and heart rate 128/min. Bronchial breath sounds on left side and bilateral crackles were heard. Spleen was mildly enlarged without any free fluid in the abdomen. No cardiovascular or neurological abnormality was noted. On local examination, ankles were erythematic and oedematous. His right foot had cellulites with pustular discharge. His right knee was also swollen.
Laboratory investigations revealed that multiple hematological and biochemical parameters were deranged [Table 1]. Urine and blood samples were sent for culture.
His chest X-ray showed homogenous consolidation in upper left lobe and diffuse alveolar opacities in remaining part of lung [Figure 1]. Ultra sound revealed mild bilateral pleural effusion and mild ascitis with enlarged spleen. No focal lesions or organomegaly were noted.
Post admission his condition further deteriorated and had clinical evidences of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, deranged blood gases, and was in respiratory distress. His oxygen saturation was 78%. With this background, he was put on ventilator and started with Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Clindamycin.
On day 2, endotracheal secretion was sent for culture. Gram negative bacilli were seen on gram stain. Non fermenting pale colonies with metallic sheen were isolated next day on Blood agar and Mac Conkey agar; the isolate was further processed on Microscan Walkaway 96 Si. Patient was continued with the same antibiotics. His total count, however, further increased to 26,000/cubic mm.
 


On day 4, the isolate was identified as Burkhlorderia pseudomallei, sensitive to Imipenem, Cotrimoxazole/Sulfamethoxazole, Tetracycline and resistant to Ceftazidime. Later on, both his blood cultures and pus drained from right leg [Figure 4] also grew B. pseudomallei. Based on the sensitivity report, antibiotic was changed to a combination of Imipenem and Doxycycline. Patient showed improvement, his fever subsided, total counts decreased, oxygen saturation was 100%, and was extubated on day 8.
His antibiotics were continued and after complete recovery and improvement of his liver and renal parameters he was discharged on day 20.

"A 58-year-old woman with a history of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) 9 years ago and recurrent LCH 3 years ago presented with redness and fever around the right eye. The patient reported presenting to another hospital with similar complaints 20 days ago, where she was diagnosed with ophthalmic herpes zoster and cellulitis. Subsequently, intravenous treatments with sulbactam-ampicillin (SAM) and acyclovir were initiated. Similar skin lesions developed around the other eye on the sixth day of SAM treatment, and linezolid (LNZ) was added to the treatment. Acyclovir treatment was switched to ganciclovir due to concerns about resistance. The patient, who did not respond to LNZ and SAM, had her treatment revised to include daptomycin (DA) and meropenem (MEM) on the sixth day of LNZ treatment. A skin biopsy on day 20 of her hospitalization was concluded as “diffuse mixed inflammatory cell infiltration rich in perifollicular neutrophils.”
On physical examination, she exhibited diffuse hyperemia around the right eye and erythematous annular indurated plaques on the right frontal region (Figure 1). Her vital signs were stable. Blood cultures were performed, and initial laboratory studies revealed the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) 107 mg/L, white blood cell (WBC) count 24,500/mm3 [1.8% eosinophil, eosinophil count 400/mm3 (range=0.03-0.27)]. SAM and valacyclovir were initiated. We wondered if the lesions were caused by skin involvement of LCH. A skin biopsy was performed because she did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics at the external center. On the fourth day of treatment, preseptal cellulitis was detected in the magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit, leading to a revision of the treatment plan to include DA and piperacillin-tazobactam. Fluconazole was also started for the fungal infection due to the lack of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The skin biopsy was performed on day 10 of antibiotic therapy and day 6 of antifungal therapy. The biopsy results included findings of an orthokeratotic stratum corneum, focal hypergranulosis, spongiosis, exocytosis, basal vacuolar degeneration, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration, including eosinophils in the dermal layer around the vessels, and on the vessel walls, as well as extravasated erythrocytes. No basal membrane thickening was observed using the histochemical periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain method, and there was no evidence of a slight increase in dermal mucin with alcian blue staining. Immunohistochemical assays for CD14, CD68, and S-100 yielded nonspecific results. These findings were interpreted as consistent with EC (Figure 2). Thereupon, the antimicrobial treatment of the patient was discontinued. The patient was given 40 mg/kg/day of systemic prednisolone for three days. Her lesions were significantly regressed on day 3 of the treatment (Figure 3). She was discharged with full recovery and prescribed a maintenance treatment with oral and topical steroids. The CRP level measured 130 mg/L on the initial day of treatment, and it decreased to 8 mg/L by the 12th day of steroid therapy. A high WBC count (27,100/mm3) was considered to be compatible with the use of steroids.","Diagnosis:

Eosinophilic Cellulitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The skin biopsy results indicate findings like orthokeratotic stratum corneum, focal hypergranulosis, spongiosis, exocytosis, basal vacuolar degeneration, eosinophil infiltration, and extravasated erythrocytes, which are consistent with EC. Termination of antimicrobial treatment and administration of systemic steroids led to significant regression of the lesions, further supporting this diagnosis.

"The 25-year old male caucasian patient suffered from an autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder (ALPS) that was treated by splenectomy 24 months before this event. He had no previous episodes of severe infections. In March 2014, he developed malaise, chills and abdominal pain of sudden onset after heavy exercise, and contacted his nearest outpatient clinic. A routine check-up involving ECG, chest X-ray, blood pressure measurement and determination of O2-saturation showed no significant abnormalities. Blood results showed slightly elevated leukocyte counts with 11.3 G/L, normal red blood cell counts (4.78 T/L) and normal platelets with 294 G/L (see Table  Table1).1). The patient was sent home after transfusion of 1 L isotonic infusion solution and symptomatic therapy with metamizol and paracetamol.
Eight hours later, the general condition of the patient worsened rapidly and he had to be hospitalized because at that time he had already developed leukopenia (2.8 G/L), his platelet levels were low (108 G/L) and the serum creatinine was elevated (2.0 mg/dl). Hemostasis parameters were also altered (again depicted in Table  Table1).1). A rapid test for S. pneumoniae-antigen was positive and although antimicrobial therapy was started immediately, the patient developed hemodynamic problems (systolic RR: 50 mmHg) and had to be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU). In spite of catecholaminergic therapy, fluid resuscitation and intubation, the organ dysfunction of the patient deteriorated and he developed severe septic shock with metabolic acidosis (lactate 15 mmol/L), anuric renal failure, overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and fast spreading necrotic skin lesions, resembling purpura fulminans.
Thus, the patient received fibrinogen (Haemocomplettan®, CSL Behring) and prothrombincomplex (Beriplex®, CSL Behring) alongside clindamycin, linezolid and intravenous immunoglobulins (Pentaglobin®, Biotest Pharma GmbH) and was transferred to our intensive care unit at the Medical University of Vienna.
Upon admission, his hemodynamic and respiratory situation was stable. The metabolic acidosis, however, worsened: lactate levels increased to 18 mmol/L and signs of hepatic impairment were detectable with elevated transaminases and hypoglycemia. Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) levels were massively increased at 6678 U/L and myoglobin values were at 11,500 ng/mL. The skin lesions progressed, and confluent lesions spread over the whole face, both hands and both feet. Hemostasis parameters showed thrombocytopenia (33 G/L), a PT of 31%, an aPTT of >180 s, fibrinogen values of 72 mg/dl and massively elevated D-Dimer levels (72.19 μg/ml), resembling septic coagulopathy with purpura fulminans. According to local and international recommendations, coagulation therapy with a plasma-derived protein C concentrate (Ceprotin®, Baxalta), was initiated. An initial bolus dose of 100 U/kg body weight was given, followed by 10 U/kg/h, aiming for plasma protein C activity values of 100 U/dL. Additional hemostatic therapy consisted of fibrinogen and platelet concentrates, antithrombin replacement (aiming for antithrombin levels of 100 U/dL), and low dose heparin infusion (250 U/kg BW/h). Moreover, extracorporeal renal replacement therapy had to be started because of acute renal failure.
Table  Table11 summarizes the blood parameters as well as clinical scores from the initial presentation at the outpatient clinic of the peripheral hospital until day 5 upon admission on our intensive care unit.
Under this treatment the patient could be successfully stabilized. Although CK and myoglobin values continued to increase during the next 3 days and the face and the limbs of the patient were impressively hypoperfused, there were no signs for a compartment syndrome, and no surgical intervention was necessary. After peaking at day 3 upon admission, CK values decreased within the next weeks until returning into the normal range after 4 weeks. In parallel, also the hemostaseologic parameters improved and the skin situation ameliorated.
The renal situation, however, remained unchanged and until week 4 no sufficient renal function could be established. Therefore, the patient was changed from continuous hemofiltration to intermittent hemodialysis, which was well tolerated. Creatinine levels were constantly high, peaking with 7.95 mg/dl.
After 27 days, the patient could be transferred from the intensive care unit to our infectiological ward, where he stayed for another 26 days. Within this stay and under forced fluid substitution, his creatinine levels returned almost into normal range (1.27 mg/dl); also the urine output increased, so renal replacement therapy could be stopped after 4 weeks upon admission. In following, renal function returned to normal. The local skin situation improved constantly, necrotic areas were surgically removed and healed decently.
The patient could be finally transferred to a rehabilitation center, from which he was discharged fully recovered.","Diagnosis:

Severe Septic Shock with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale: The patient presents with symptoms of sepsis, including fever, chills, hypotension, and leukocytosis. He also has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),"
"A 37-year-old previously healthy male presented to the emergency room (ER) with complaints of weakness and fatigue, double vision and photophobia of few hours’ duration. It was not associated with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain or any change in bowel habits. There was no chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or loss of consciousness. No recent medications were started.
The patients’ past medical history (PMH), past surgical history (PSH) and family history (FH) were unremarkable. He was not on regular medications with no allergies and denied any history of smoking.
On examination, the patient was vitally stable and afebrile. His abdominal, respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination was difficult to assess, as patient was very drowsy. However, plantars were down going, and pupils were pinpoint bilaterally. There were no obvious needle marks and lower limb examination was normal.
Laboratory investigations (hematological and biochemical) were all within normal levels. CT Brain was also done at the level of the ER that was unremarkable.
The patient was admitted to the ward with the initial impression of reduced level of consciousness with isolated medical 3rd nerve palsy. Drug overdose was a differential at the time of admission. Drug levels (Acetaminophen), urine toxicology and MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) brain were requested. The patient also received a dose of Naloxone that improved his level of consciousness for a short period of time.
The Neurologist saw the patient the next day in the ward, and examination showed response to painful stimuli. He was vitally stable with neck rigidity and positive Kernig’s sign. The right pupil was constricted whereas the left one was dilated. Plantars were down going bilaterally.
A differential diagnosis of absence seizure, meningitis and possible stroke was made. The patient was kept in isolation and planned for lumbar puncture (LP). He was also scheduled for an electroencephalogram (EEG), MRI brain and Carotid Doppler. After LP was done, he was started on Ceftriaxone 2 g once daily, Vancomycin 1600 mg every 8 hours intravenously and Acyclovir 800 mg every 8 hours intravenously. He was also started on Keppra 1 g twice daily intravenously as a prophylaxis for seizure disorder.
When patient was reviewed the next day, he was fully conscious. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes and calcium, C-reactive protein (CRP), hepatitis profile, Syphilis, HIV, Toxoplasmosis screen, ANA and lipid profile were normal. However, Protein C and S were elevated―>141% and >126% respectively. CSF analysis showed elevated protein level (80 mg/dl). The gram stain showed no organism, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) negative and cultures were negative.
MRI Brain showed acute infarcts in bilateral thalamus, meningeal irritation (Figure 1) and bilateral sinusitis. There were sharp wave discharges in both temporo-occipital regions on his EEG (Figure 2). Carotid Doppler showed no stenosis or atherosclerotic plaques.

"A 43 years old male, smoker, not known to have any significant medical illness came to our hospital with 2 days history of fever and altered sensorium and no other significant neurological history. The patient did not take COVID-19 vaccine and had no recent travel.
On examination, he was found conscious but confused, not oriented, and not obeying to commands. Pupils were equal and reacting, fundus examination – normal, no focal neurological deficit, and no signs of meningeal irritation. He was mildly febrile, maintaining saturation of 96% on room air. His blood pressure was elevated − 172/109. Chest and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. Blood investigations showed normal WBC and lymphocyte count with normal renal and liver function tests, with negative toxicology screen and negative serology.
Consequently, the patient was admitted as case of acute confusion state. To rule out meningoencephalitis, CT head without contrast was done and was normal. He was tested positive for COVID-19. The patient was started on acyclovir, antibiotics, and steroids. LP done showed normal biochemistry and HSV 1 and 2 serology negative.
The next day, patient’s consciousness level deteriorated and had pupillary asymmetry with dilated and nonreactive right pupil. He was intubated and ventilated. Repeated CT brain showed no newly developed vascular insult during the time interval. Brain MRI with MRA was done and showed posterior circulation (AOP) stroke represented by bilateral medial thalamus and midbrain infarcts (shown in Fig. 1, 2) with nonvisualization of posterior cerebral artery.

"A 64-year-old man suffering from rapid onset aphasia and progressive weakness in his right leg was evaluated on July 13, 2003. His neurological examination revealed moderate deterioration in his speech and a mild monoparesis (4/5) in his right leg. His routine laboratory investigation was normal. His computerized tomography (CT) was compatible with the changes attributable to his age, without any signs of an acute process. His medical history was unremarkable except for hypertension and a surgery for knee prosthesis. The diagnosis was transient ischemic attack after rapid improvement in his neurological signs. Further investigation revealed a small plaque in his left internal carotid artery with no hemodynamic alterations and an aneurismal dilatation at the cardiac apex with a suspicious thrombus within. The decision was to follow him up with antiplatelet therapy. Unfortunately 48 Turkish Neurosurgery 2007, Vol: 17, No: 1, 48-54 Börcek: Ischemic Stroke Complicated by a Brain Abscess he presented with alteration in consciousness and right hemiparesis (3/5) on September 23. His radiological and laboratory investigation on admission were again normal. However, his control CT revealed a left occipito-parietal hypodense lesion compatible with left posterior cerebral artery infarction (Figure 1). The patient was hospitalized and given proper treatment. The diagnosis was ischemic stroke. to the lateral margin of the infarct site that was shaped like a ring, showed hyperdensity and was nearly 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2). The lesion was not demonstrating any mass effect and there was no obvious edema around it. The radiological interpretation was not clear because of the doubt whether the lesion was a hematoma in the absorption phase or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not be performed to rule out Figure 1: CT image demonstrating left occipito-parietal hypodense lesion compatible with left posterior cerebral artery infarction. After his discharge with moderate deficits, he was readmitted because of high fever and decreased level of consciousness on December 19, 2003. His body temperature was 39.3 C. His laboratory findings supported an acute infectious process: erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h, C-reactive protein 58 mg/dl, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dl, white blood cell count 18700/mm3 and slight hepatic dysfunction with relevant values. His neurological examination revealed a right hemiparesis that was interpreted as a sequel of his previous stroke, and diminished consciousness. The chest x-ray and urinalysis results were normal. His cranial tomography with contrast medium showed the previous infarct site at the left occipito-parietal region. Additionally, there was another lesion closer Figure 2: Patient’s enhanced CT revealing a ring-like shaped lesion over the previous infarct any of these diagnoses because of his incompatible knee prosthesis. Given the possibility of a brain abscess, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was performed. The opening pressure was 160 mmH2O. The laboratory results were as follows: leukocyte count 2700/mm3 with 96% neutrophils, glucose level 0.3 mmol/L and protein level 5.8 g/L. The gram stain and the culture of the CSF were negative, just like the other samples (urine, sputum and blood). Since the CSF findings were compatible with a central nervous system infection, he was administered high dose, empirical antibiotic therapy (imipenem 6 gr/day). We did not perform a surgery not only because of the patient’s unstable cardiac condition but also because the lesion’s small size allowed us to follow the patient up. The patient improved gradually with antibiotics 49 Turkish Neurosurgery 2007, Vol: 17, No: 1, 48-54 Börcek: Ischemic Stroke Complicated by a Brain Abscess and supportive management. The control CT on the 2nd week of therapy showed a decrease in the size and enhancement of the lesion. Following intravenous antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks, He was discharged with mild deficits.

"We report the case of a 12-year old boy who was admitted to our institution for sudden onset of right-sided weakness. Four days prior to admission he started to have low to moderate grade intermittent fever associated with occasional non-paroxysmal unproductive cough. He was prescribed with Clarithromycin, antihistamine, and β2-agonist medications, with resolution of symptoms. The fever recurred 1 day prior to admission associated with 2 episodes of non projectile vomiting of previously ingested food, and a throbbing frontal mild to moderate headache. About 12 h prior to admission, the patient could no longer move his right upper and lower extremities, prompting transport to the hospital where he had an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures lasting for 10 sec. The past medical history revealed that the patient had a bout of fever and cough about 3 weeks prior to admission, for which he was prescribed Amoxicillin-clavulanic and Salbutamol, with subsequent improvement. In the emergency room, the patient was examined conscious, coherent, oriented to 3 spheres, verbal but unable to move his right upper and lower extremities, and febrile at 38.6oC. The systemic physical examination findings were generally normal. However, the neurologic examination revealed a flattened right nasolabial fold, inability to lift his right shoulder, and deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion. There was 0/5 motor strength of the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski sign present at the right. Hyporeflexia was noted on the right upper and lower extremities. The patient was initially admitted as childhood stroke, and was worked up along this impression. There was neutrophilia seen in the complete blood count. This, together with the fever prompted administration of antibiotics. Hyponatremia at 127.5 mEq/L was seen. The prothrombin time was prolonged with an activity of 57.4% while the activated partial thromboplastin time was normal. The lipid profile showed low High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). The urinalysis was normal. The chest radiograph and the 2-dimensional echocardiography were normal. The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontal lobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction (Figure 1). The fever resolved on the third day of hospitalization while on the antibiotics, but the motor deficits did not improve. Physical therapy was started. By the sixth day of hospitalization, the patient’s motor strength on the right upper and lower extremity was seen to be 2/5, which further improved to 3/5 the next day. Rehabilitation therapy and the antibiotics were continued. The patient’s condition was progressively improving, when on the 17th hospital day there was note of sudden regression of the motor strength of the affected side to 0/5. Anisocoria was also noted. A re-stroke was considered so a repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed; this time, multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect, consistent with a brain abscess (Figure 2). A neurosurgery referral was made, and a contrast-enhanced brain CT scan was preceded, Figure 1: The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontal lobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction. Figure 4: A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37th hospital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe, surrounding vasogenic edema and expansile effect, right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect. Figure 2: A repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed; this time, multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect, consistent with a brain abscess.

Medical and surgical decompression was done. Antibiotics were shifted to Metronidazole, Amikacin, and Meropenem per brain abscess guidelines. Post-operatively, the patient’s pupils became isocoric; the motor strength in the right lower extremity was 1/5 while the motor strength in the right upper extremity was 0/5. With the medications and rehabilitation, his condition gradually improved. By the 8th post-op day, he was already able to gain full motor strength in the right leg while the right arm strength improved to 2/5. A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37th hospital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe, surrounding vasogenic edema and expansile effect, right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect (Figure 4). Aspiration of the abscess was performed. Culture of the abscess fluid did not yield any growth. Antibiotics were continued. A repeat cranial CT scan on the 42nd hospital day showed interval decrease in size of rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe and interval decrease in rightward subfalcine herniation, still with vasogenic edema. Medications were continued and further clinical improvement was noted (Figure 5). Patient was discharged on the 45th hospital day already isocoric, with full strength in both lower extremities and left upper extremity, and residual weakness in the right upper extremity.","Diagnosis:

"A 59-year-old nursing home patient with Down syndrome had high fever unresponsive to paracetamol, and unproductive cough for 4 d. Accordingly, cefriaxone was administered with some improvement (defervescence and reduction of cough). After the reappearance of fever associated with dyspnea, acrocyanosis, and her deteriorating condition, she was brought to the emergency room, and on initial evaluation she was admitted to the internal medicine department of our hospital. She had a ventricular (pacing), ventricular (sensing), inhibition (response) (and) rate-adaptive holder pacemaker because of a third degree atrioventricular block. Furthermore, her past medical history included chronic cerebrovascular disease due to previous ischemic strokes complicated by vascular dementia and epilepsy. The latter was possibly due to Alzheimer-like disease as is often seen in down syndrome patients. On arrival in the internal medicine department the patient was drowsy, tachypneic, tachycardic, low blood pressure (80/50 mmHg) and hypoxemic (PaO2 57 mmHg). The thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of bilateral basal parenchymal opacities. The patient was treated empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin according to protocol for health care-associated pneumonia. An initial bed-side echocardiogram evaluation revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 36%, and dilatation of the right ventricle with medium-apical akinesis. In addition to fluid resuscitation, dopamine, dobutamin, and norepinephrine infusion were administred. At times simultaneous administration of two vaso-active amines was necessary to achieve hemodynamic stabilization and adequate diuresis. The first electrocardiogram showed regular activation of the pacemaker and subsequent evaluations revealed repolarization abnormalities of probable hypoxic nature in the inferior wall only (Figure 1).
 
The results of blood tests are shown in Table 1, reporting thrombocytopenia (80000 103/μL) and the peak serum concentration of troponin I (16.9 ng/mL - reference range < 0.012 ng/mL).

This evidence does not rule out an acute ischemic event, but could be seen as suggesting Tako-Tsubo syndrome. The differential diagnosis also concerned pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and myocarditis. The former was excluded through execution of CT angiography. In relation to myocardial infarction and myocarditis, it was not possible to perform coronary angiography or a myocardial biopsy. However, the absence of persistent regional abnormalities ruled out acute coronary syndrome. The third transthoracic echocardiogram showed complete remission of the regional abnormalities (E.F. 50%). The patient was discharged after gradual weaning from vaso-active amines in adequate clinical condition. Therefore, our patient had survived, in spite of severe cardiac involvement and possible Tako-Tsubo syndrome.","Diagnosis:

"A 28-year old woman presented to the respiratory clinic with a history of progressive cough and breathlessness over the preceding 2–3 years. Her exercise capacity on initial presentation was consistent with an MRC Dyspnoea score of 4. She also described associated wheeze, chest tightness and a nocturnal cough.
The patient smoked 20 cigarettes per day and had a twelve year pack history. She is a college student with three children and pet dog and no relevant employment. She denied any illicit drug use including cannabis. Her other past medical history was that of Hypothyroidism. She was a term delivery at birth.
There appeared to be a significant family history of early diagnosis COPD with her mother and maternal grandmother diagnosed with the condition in their thirties. Furthermore one of her sons is an asthmatic.
A Chest X-ray (Fig. 1) was reported as showing hyper inflated lungs and possible upper zone emphysema.
 

Spirometry (Fig. 2) demonstrated airflow obstruction with an FEV1 of 52% predicted and ratio of 49%. There was no significant FEV1 reversibility following a steroid trial. Lung volumes showed evidence of hyperinflation with a total lung capacity of 144% and RV 237%. Gas transfer showed a TLCO of 60% and KCO of 55% predicted. These results were consistent with COPD and emphysema. An HRCT (Fig. 3) showed extensive centrolobular emphysema with an upper lobe predominance. Blood tests including an Alpha – 1 Antitrypsin level were normal.

 

Her initial management consisted of Salbutamol 100 mcg QID and Fluticasone/Salmeterol 500 μg/50 μg BD. Smoking cessation was strongly encouraged.
Following subsequent reviews she had presented to A&E and her GP surgery with episodic periods of increased cough, wheeze and sputum production requiring treatment with enteral steroids and antibiotics. She was also commenced on Tiotropium 18 mcg OD. Unfortunately the patient has continued to smoke despite repeated discussions regarding the implications of this.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a rare condition in the young and is generally not diagnosed in the under 40s. Despite the diurnal variation seen at presentation the spirometry and HRCT findings in this case point very clearly towards such a diagnosis.
There is a dearth of contemporaneous literature available for non-Antitrypsin related COPD in a young person with the most relevant articles at least eighteen years old.
Critchley et al., describe a new diagnosis of congenital lobar emphysema presenting in a pregnant young woman. However this was limited to the left upper lobe and thus surgically resectable, unlike the diffuse bilateral apical emphysema found in typical emphysema","Diagnosis:

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients presentation with progressive cough, breathlessness, wheeze, and chest tightness, along with a history of significant smoking, strong family history of COPD, and spirometry findings of airflow obstruction with no reversibility, are strongly indicative of COPD with emphysema. The chest X-ray and HRCT findings further corroborate this diagnosis.

Two days prior to her visit to the ED, she underwent a tooth extraction at her dentist’s office where her left mandibular first molar was removed. The patient received bupivacaine with epinephrine injection for local anesthesia. Later review of dental records indicated that a pressurized air turbine dental drill had then been used for resection of the tooth prior to extraction.
Her vital signs in the ED were as follows: blood pressure of 124/68 millimeters of mercury; heart rate 82 beats per minute; respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation of 98% on room air; and oral temperature 36.8° Celsius. Physical examination showed an uncomfortable-appearing female who was expectorating saliva into an emesis basin. She exhibited slight dysphonia but no stridor, and was able to speak in full sentences without difficulty. The patient exhibited tenderness to palpation over the left mandible with mild cheek edema, without erythema. Partial dislodgement of blood clot overlying the left first mandibular molar (tooth number 19) was noted. The trachea was midline and there was no meningismus, although she had increased midline neck pain with resistance to neck extension (secondary to pain). She had palpable crepitus over the neck and anterior chest wall.
Laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 6.8 thousand per microliter (K/uL) (reference range 3.5–11.3 k/uL), hemoglobin of 15.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (ref range 11.9–15.1 g/dL), platelet count of 300 (K/uL) (ref range 138–453 K/uL), and C-reactive protein 8 milligrams per liter (mg/L) (ref range < 5 mg/L). A computed tomography (CT) soft tissue neck with intravenous (IV) contrast was performed, which demonstrated extensive air accumulation involving the oral, retropharyngeal space, and pneumomediastinum (Image). After consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon, the decision was made to begin prophylactic antibiotics. She was started on IV maintenance fluids and ampicillin-sulbactam for broad spectrum coverage including oral flora .

(B) CT with intravenous contrast (sagittal) demonstrating extension of the subcutaneous emphysema from the left lower molar tooth into the retropharyngeal space and mediastinum (arrows).
The patient was admitted for observation and discharged three days later. An esophagram taken to rule out esophageal damage showed that the esophagus appeared to be without injury and was functioning normally. The patient received a follow-up phone call one week after being discharged and reported complete resolution of symptoms.","Diagnosis:

Subcutaneous Emphysema

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of palpable crepitus over the neck and anterior chest wall, as well as the CT findings of extensive air accumulation in the oral, retropharyngeal spaces, and pneumomediastinum, strongly point towards subcutaneous emphysema. This condition often occurs after dental procedures, especially when air turbine dental drills are used.

Suitable Treatments:
* Prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g, ampicillin-sulbactam) to prevent infection, IV maintenance fluids, and close observation
* In most cases, the condition resolves spontaneously without further intervention"
"53-year-old female with a past medical history of celiac disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department after a sudden onset of right-sided facial and eye swelling. She was seen earlier that morning at a local dental office, where she underwent a replacement of a prior filling. Upon presentation, a review of systems was negative except for right-sided blurry vision. She denied headache, nausea, emesis, dyspnea, chest pain, fever, or rash. She had no allergies and received no new medications during the procedure. Vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was remarkable for crepitus of the right lateral neck, mandibular, midface, and periorbital area (Figure 1).


CT of the soft tissue of the neck and chest was obtained. Imaging revealed extensive pneumomediastinum, the right greater than the left, with an extension into the soft tissues of the neck and adjacent to and within the right orbit without the evidence of pneumothorax, focal inflammation, or abscess.


 


Figure 1: Multiple CT views showing extensive subcutaneous emphysema
 

Oral maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) and thoracic surgery were consulted. OMFS recommended the initiation of prophylactic amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate for a one-week duration along with Peridex rinse twice daily. Thoracic surgery evaluated the patient and agreed with the initiation of prophylactic antibiotics. Neither surgical service recommended surgical intervention. The patient desired to be discharged home with close outpatient follow-up. Return precautions, including worsening swelling, chest pain, dyspnea, and fever, were given to the patient upon discharge.
She was re-evaluated for acute shortness of breath and tachypnea in the emergency department approximately one week after her initial presentation. Her clinical presentation was concerning for pulmonary embolism. Repeat CT of the chest was performed and did not reveal pulmonary embolism but did reveal a vast improvement in subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum from the week prior without any interventions. She was diagnosed with a panic attack and discharged home.","Diagnosis:

Subcutaneous Emphysema and Pneumomediastinum

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The clinical presentation and CT imaging findings are consistent with this. The crepitus in the neck and facial areas, along with extensive pneumomediastinum visualized in imaging, corroborate this diagnosis. Given her recent dental procedure, air could have been inadvertently introduced into the fascial planes of the neck and face.

Suitable Treatments:
* Amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate: Prophylactic antibiotics are important to prevent secondary infections in areas of disrupted tissue
* - Chlorhexidine Gluconate (Peridex) Rinse: To maintain oral hygiene and minimize the risk of infection
* - Observation: Close outpatient follow-up to monitor the resolution of air pockets and to ensure no secondary complications like infection or further air leakage"

"A two-month-old girl was transferred from a local hospital to the pediatric ICU of a tertiary hospital because of cough and wheezing for 10 days, which worsened after six days.
The child had a history of asphyxia and weak physical condition. She was diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia and was hospitalized for seven days at another hospital.
On admission, the infant had an acute facial appearance, with anhidrosis on the left side of the face, hyperhidrosis on the right side, tachypnea, and three depressions sign. After oral ibuprofen administration and physical cooling, the body temperature decreased slowly. When fever was high, the patient experienced convulsions, cough, wheezing, and diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) performed at another hospital revealed a high-density shadow in the right lower lung and a large soft tissue mass in the posterior mediastinum. Enhanced CT tomography revealed a space-occupying lesion in the posterior mediastinum. Combined with the results for neuron-specific enolase (71.72 ng/mL), the possibility of neuroblastoma was considered. The patient subsequently underwent mediastinal tumor resection under general anesthesia, and the surgery was successful. The child had persistent symptoms, such as fever, convulsions, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness, postoperatively. After the relevant examinations, paraneoplastic syndrome was considered, and isotretinoin was administered orally to induce tumor differentiation.
The child had multiple infections during hospitalization. After admission, the result of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae nucleic acid test of the throat swab was 4.024×E5Copies/mL, indicating the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Subsequent bacterial culture of the tracheal tube tip suggested hemolytic Staphylococcus, indicating the presence of bacterial infection. The1–3 -β-D-glucan test was 160.79pg/mL, and Aspergillus galactomannan test was 0.35ug/L, indicating fungal infection. To control and prevent further infection, a variety of antibiotics, such as cefotaxime sodium, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefoperazone sulbactam sodium, azithromycin, vancomycin, meropenem, linezolid, voriconazole, and metronidazole, are used throughout the hospital stay. During the third month of hospitalization, the patient’s sputum smear showed a large number of gram-positive bacilli outside the white blood cells on Gram staining (Figure 1A) and weak acid-fast staining was positive (Figure 1B). The sputum culture grew dry, rough, branched, and slightly yellow-pigmented colonies on Columbia Blood Agar Base Medium (Figure 1Cand D). MALDI-TOF MS of Merieux VITEK MS identity the colonies as Tsukamurella species (Figure 2A), and the DNA (Ezup column bacterial genomic DNA extraction kit, sangon Biotech, Shanghai) of the bacterial strain was extracted for 16S rRNA sequencing (sangon Biotech, Shanghai), and the base pair matching of the sequencing results showed that the Query Cover 99%, E value 0.0, per.ident 99.80%. After sequencing and comparing the results, the colony from the sputum was determined to be Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens, which was subsequently cultured from the tracheal apex catheter of the patient. MALDI-TOF MS compared with 16S rRNA, time and cost advantages, but can only be identified to species level, and there is a certain error detection rate.4Unfortunately, despite active treatments, such as anti-infection, immune regulation with gamma globulin, methylprednisolone pulse therapy, intravenous nutritional support, and invasive ventilator-assisted ventilation, the patient’s family required abandonment of treatment due to her critical condition and threatened life. The patient was discharged with a stomach tube during the third month of hospitalization.

"A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with intermittent diarrhea for the previous 5 days, which developed soon after eating food that he believed was contaminated. He also had reduced urine volume for the previous 3 days.
Physical examination
Examination on admission showed that his temperature was 38.5 °C, HR was 128 bpm, respiration was 2/m, and BP was 70/40 mmHg. There was no evidence of lung or cardiac abnormalities. His abdomen was slightly puffy and soft, with upper abdominal pressure, and he experienced back pain and bowel “chirping” 5-6 times/min.
Laboratory examinations
His hemoglobin level was 18.3 g/dL, the total white blood cell count was 21.4 × 109/L, there were 71.9% neutral granulocytes, and the platelet count was 169 × 109/L. The patient also had metabolic acidosis, with a blood gas pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 30 mmHg, PO2 of 66 mmHg (FiO2 60%), PO2/FiO2 of 110 mmHg, bicarbonate of 16.6 mmol/L, a base excess of -9.0 mmol/L, and lactate of 3.5 mmol/L. The aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) was 573.1 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 47 U/L, total bilirubin was 7.58 µmol/L, serum creatinine (SCr) was 708.8 µmol/L, urea was 20.48 mmol/L, and albumin was 26.9 g/L. The prothrombin time was 12.5 s, activated partial thromboplastin time was 31.3 s, international normalized ratio was 1.08, and procalcitonin (PCT) was 32.60 ng/mL. Because the ASP was highly elevated and the AST was moderately elevated, we conducted tests to determine the possible cause. All tests for hepatitis (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb, and HCV) were negative, as were all tests for autoimmune hepatitis (antinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antigen, soluble liver antigen antibodies, liver-kidney microsome-1, and other autoantibodies).
Salmonella and Shigella were not detected in a stool culture, and the tests for Clostridium difficile toxin A toxin B were also negative. Most fecal cocci were Gram-negative bacilli, and there were a few Gram-positive.
Empirical treatment with meropenem began within 1 h of admission, and blood cultures were obtained. The blood culture showed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to meropenem, so we continued its use.
According to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)[6], we diagnosed the patient as having Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia, sepsis, septic shock, and septic AKI. His Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was 18 points, with a 42.9% risk of death, and his Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 10.
The patient was in critical condition. To treat the sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, we administered 2500 mL of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 h and established invasive dynamic hemodynamic monitoring. Following the initial fluid resuscitation, we performed frequent reassessment of his hemodynamic status to guide administration of additional fluids. The patients blood pressure increased slightly to 80/55 mmHg, and we administered noradrenaline to achieve the initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg.
We also initiated CRRT using an oXiris®hemofilter (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, United States), which is designed for removal of cytokines adsorption of endotoxins, using a Prismaflex version 8.0 machine (Gambro Industries, Meyzieu, France). A vascular path was established using a 12-French double-lumen catheter in the right femoral vein. The prescription was set up as pre-dilution. The mode of CRRT was continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at 30 mL/kg per hour, and the CRRT machine was primed with normal heparinized saline and regional citrate for anticoagulation. The blood flow rate was 150 L/min. The hemofiltration prescription was adjusted based on electrolyte and acid-base results and the oXiris® hemofilter was changed every 12 h to ensure adsorption efficacy. Except for mild hypocalcemia, which required intravenous calcium supplementation, the patient experienced no significant complications.
After administering meropenem and CRRT with the oXiris® filter for 72 h, the patients vital signs were stable, and the infection was well controlled. We also reduced the noradrenaline infusion to a minimum of 0.05 µg/kg per minute during the CRRT, and stopped it at 65 h after initiation of treatment. After 6 h, the lactate level was 2.1 mmol/L and lactate clearance rate was 40%. At that time, inflammation-related parameters [endotoxin, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10] had markedly declined. In addition, the PCT level decreased from 32.60 ng/mL to 4.98 ng/mL during the 72 h treatment period (Figure (Figure2A).2A). His urine volume gradually increased over the course of 10 d (Figure (Figure2B).2B). Over the course of 3 d, his SCr gradually decreased from 708.8 µmol/L to 241 µmol/L, his SOFA score decreased from 10 to 3 , and his APACHE II score decreased from 18 to 6. After he was hemodynamically stable, we changed to a traditional filter (AN69 hemofilter) and used intermittent CVVHDF. We discontinued CRRT after the recovery of kidney function on day 20. After 25 d of treatment in the ICU, there was significant amelioration of the septic shock, and we discharged the patient. The patients kidney function eventually returned to normal.","Diagnosis:

Klebsiella pneumoniae Bacteremia

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: Blood cultures confirmed Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the patient meets the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis and septic shock. The patient exhibits symptoms of severe sepsis, including elevated lactate levels, reduced urine output, persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, and a significant drop in blood pressure. High procalcitonin levels further support bacterial infection and sepsis.

Suitable Treatments:
* fluid challenge, antibiotic, support therapy, plasmapheresis"
"63-year-old Aboriginal man was referred by a general practitioner to a rural hospital emergency department. The patient presented with 24 hours of epigastric pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea, generalized muscle aches, and fever. The preceding night, the patient had eaten a piece of chicken that he had cooked after it had been refrigerated for a few days. The patient was an ex-smoker, was moderately obese, and had long-standing type 2 diabetes being treated with insulin and complicated by diabetic nephropathy (baseline serum creatinine 300–320 μmol/L) and peripheral vascular disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II symptoms), hypertension, and depression. Over the preceding 2 years, he had been managed in the outpatient heart failure clinic with review every 6–8 weeks. His heart failure symptoms had been deemed to be stable at his last review 6 weeks before presentation. The patient’s regular medications were low-dose aspirin, bisoprolol, fluvoxamine, gliclazide MR, insulin glargine, fenofibrate, simvastatin, and inhaled fluticasone/salmeterol. The patient lived alone and was functionally independent with activities of daily living.
Upon presentation to hospital, his initial examination was remarkable only for fever. Blood biochemistry showed raised inflammatory markers and chronically elevated creatinine (Table 1). The patient was admitted to the general medical ward of a rural district hospital for supportive treatment with a presumptive diagnosis of infective gastroenteritis. Initial management included intravenous fluid rehydration and antiemetics. His fluid status was monitored, and his regular medications, including insulin and inhaled bronchodilators, were continued.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient continued to have intermittent high fevers. Empirical antibiotics were commenced (intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g three times daily). Blood cultures subsequently grew C. perfringens and E. avium; both organisms were sensitive to penicillin. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated cholelithiasis but was otherwise normal (Fig. Fig. 1). Specialist infectious disease advice was sought on two occasions, which confirmed appropriate antibiotic management. The patient continued to remain clinically stable.
Fig. 1
 
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in a patient with suspected gastroenteritis. Image was obtained within 24 hours of presentation to the hospital. CT demonstrated cholelithiasis but no other abnormality
Viral nasopharyngeal swabs were also positive for human metapneumovirus. The results of fecal nucleic acid testing were negative for other common pathogenic organisms, including enteric viruses, parasites, and bacteria. The results of viral and autoimmune hepatitis screening were negative. Urine culture performed prior to initiating antibiotics was clear. Blood film obtained 48 hours after admission showed neutrophilic toxic changes.
On the third day after presentation, the patient became visibly jaundiced and complained of mild intermittent epigastric pain. Blood biochemistry showed acute renal and hepatic injury and hyperbilirubinemia suggestive of intravascular hemolysis (Table 1). The patient was urgently transferred to a tertiary center, given the risk of deterioration.
The patient’s condition significantly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was admitted to intensive care with septic shock and renal failure. He required support with multiple inotropes and dialysis. Antibiotic cover was extended to include vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin (Table 2). Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small bowel enteritis, hepatic infarction, and portal vein thrombosis suspected to be septic thromboembolism. CT also demonstrated several hepatic hypodensities consistent with multiple abscesses, the largest measuring 41 mm in diameter (Fig. 2). Ultrasound-guided drainage was performed, and 35 ml of hemoturbid fluid was aspirated. The result of culture of the hepatic abscess was positive for E. avium.

Fig. 2
 
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis 72 hours after presentation to the hospital showing multiple lobulated intrahepatic collections, infarction of hepatic segments 5 and 8, and septic occlusion of the portal vein. There were no gas locules associated with the abscesses. CT also demonstrated small bowel enteritis (not shown)
The patient developed refractory septic and cardiogenic shock and required intubation and ventilation. Intubation was complicated by bronchial bleeding that required transfusion and endobronchial intervention. The patient had been temporarily commenced on therapeutic heparin for portal vein thrombosis; however, this was rapidly reversed with Prothrombinex®-VF (CSL Behring, Victoria, Australia) [7]. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (estimated LV ejection fraction, 21%) but no evidence of valvular dysfunction or infective endocarditis. Despite maximal intensive care support, including intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation, the patient died 2 days after admission to intensive care, 6 days after his initial presentation.

Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens is an aerobic, weakly acid-fast, non-motile, gram-positive bacterium that colonizes various environments and can infect immunocompromised patients. Confusions are easily made when distinguishing between Actinomycetes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens. After culturing pure colonies of this strain, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the gradient diffusion method were performed (Table 1). DNA of the strain was extracted and sent for high-throughput sequencing (Uniteomics, Tianjin). Basic genomic information was also analyzed. Based on the genomic information, a constructed genome circle map described the relational and multidimensional data (Figure 2B). The pure colonies were subjected to scanning electron microscopy to further explore their morphology characteristics (Figure 3) (Xiangya Medical College of Central South University).","Diagnosis:

Examination on admission showed that his temperature was 38.5 °C, pulse (HR) was 128 bpm, RR was 22/min, and blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg. There was no evidence of lung or cardiac abnormalities. His abdomen was slightly puffy and soft, with upper abdominal pressure, and he experienced back pain and bowel “chirping” 5-6 times/min.
Laboratory examinations
His hemoglobin level was 18.3 g/dL, the total white blood cell count was 21.4x10^9/L, there were 71.9% neutral granulocytes, and the platelet count was 169x10^9/L. The patient also had metabolic acidosis, with a blood gas pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 30 mmHg, PO2 of 66 mmHg (FiO2 60%), PO2/FiO2 of 110 mmHg, bicarbonate of 16.6 mmol/L, a base excess of -9.0 mmol/L, and lactate of 3.5 mmol/L. The aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) was 573.1 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 47 U/L, total bilirubin was 7.58 µmol/L, serum creatinine (SCr) was 708.8 µmol/L, urea was 20.48 mmol/L, and albumin was 26.9 g/L. The prothrombin time was 12.5 s, activated partial thromboplastin time was 31.3 s, international normalized ratio was 1.08, and procalcitonin (PCT) was 32.60 ng/mL. Because the ASP was highly elevated and the AST was moderately elevated, we conducted tests to determine the possible cause. All tests for hepatitis (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb, and HCV) were negative, as were all tests for autoimmune hepatitis (antinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antigen, soluble liver antigen antibodies, liver-kidney microsome-1, and other autoantibodies).
Salmonella and Shigella were not detected in a stool culture, and the tests for Clostridium difficile toxin A toxin B were also negative. Most fecal cocci were Gram-negative bacilli, and there were a few Gram-positive.
Empirical treatment with meropenem began within 1 h of admission, and blood cultures were obtained. The blood culture showed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to meropenem, so we continued its use.
According to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)[6], we diagnosed the patient as having Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia, sepsis, septic shock, and septic AKI. His Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was 18 points, with a 42.9% risk of death, and his Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 10.
The patient was in critical condition. To treat the sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, we administered 2500 mL of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 h and established invasive dynamic hemodynamic monitoring. Following the initial fluid resuscitation, we performed frequent reassessment of his hemodynamic status to guide administration of additional fluids. The patients blood pressure increased slightly to 80/55 mmHg, and we administered noradrenaline to achieve the initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg.
We also initiated CRRT using an oXiris®hemofilter (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, United States), which is designed for removal of cytokines adsorption of endotoxins, using a Prismaflex version 8.0 machine (Gambro Industries, Meyzieu, France). A vascular path was established using a 12-French double-lumen catheter in the right femoral vein. The prescription was set up as pre-dilution. The mode of CRRT was continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at 30 mL/kg per hour, and the CRRT machine was primed with normal heparinized saline and regional citrate for anticoagulation. The blood flow rate was 150 L/min. The hemofiltration prescription was adjusted based on electrolyte and acid-base results and the oXiris® hemofilter was changed every 12 h to ensure adsorption efficacy. Except for mild hypocalcemia, which required intravenous calcium supplementation, the patient experienced no significant complications.
After administering meropenem and CRRT with the oXiris® filter for 72 h, the patients vital signs were stable, and the infection was well controlled. We also reduced the noradrenaline infusion to a minimum of 0.05 µg/kg per minute during the CRRT, and stopped it at 65 h after initiation of treatment (Figure (Figure1A).1A). After 6 h, the lactate level was 2.1 mmol/L and lactate clearance rate was 40%. At that time, inflammation-related parameters [endotoxin, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10] had markedly declined (Figure (Figure1B1B--D).D). In addition, the PCT level decreased from 32.60 ng/mL to 4.98 ng/mL during the 72 h treatment period (Figure (Figure2A).2A). His urine volume gradually increased over the course of 10 d (Figure (Figure2B).2B). Over the course of 3 d, his SCr gradually decreased from 708.8 µmol/L to 241 µmol/L, his SOFA score decreased from 10 to 3 (Figure (Figure2C),2C), and his APACHE II score decreased from 18 to 6 (Figure (Figure2D).2D). After he was hemodynamically stable, we changed to a traditional filter (AN69 hemofilter) and used intermittent CVVHDF. We discontinued CRRT after the recovery of kidney function on day 20. After 25 d of treatment in the ICU, there was significant amelioration of the septic shock, and we discharged the patient. The patients kidney function eventually returned to normal.","Diagnosis:

Septic shock due to Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presented with signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, hypotension) and had a positive blood culture for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The presence of septic shock is supported by the need for vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotics, fluid challenge, plasmapheresis, support therapy"
"63-year-old Aboriginal man was referred by a general practitioner to a rural hospital emergency department, ex-smoker, obese, and had long-standing type 2 diabetes being treated with insulin and complicated by diabetic nephropathy (baseline serum creatinine 300–320 μmol/L) and peripheral vascular disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II symptoms), hypertension, and depression.
 The patient presented with 24 hours of epigastric pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea, generalized muscle aches, and fever. The preceding night, the patient had eaten a piece of chicken that he had cooked after it had been refrigerated for a few days.. Over the preceding 2 years, he had been managed in the outpatient heart failure clinic with review every 6–8 weeks. His heart failure symptoms had been deemed to be stable at his last review 6 weeks before presentation. The patient’s regular medications were low-dose aspirin, bisoprolol, fluvoxamine, gliclazide MR, insulin glargine, fenofibrate, simvastatin, and inhaled fluticasone/salmeterol. The patient lived alone and was functionally independent with activities of daily living.
Upon presentation to hospital, his initial examination was remarkable only for fever. Blood biochemistry showed raised inflammatory markers and chronically elevated creatinine (Table 1). The patient was admitted to the general medical ward of a rural district hospital for supportive treatment with a presumptive diagnosis of infective gastroenteritis. Initial management included intravenous fluid rehydration and antiemetics. His fluid status was monitored, and his regular medications, including insulin and inhaled bronchodilators, were continued.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient continued to have intermittent high fevers. Empirical antibiotics were commenced (intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g three times daily). Blood cultures subsequently grew C. perfringens and E. avium; both organisms were sensitive to penicillin. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated cholelithiasis but was otherwise normal (Fig. Fig. 1). Specialist infectious disease advice was sought on two occasions, which confirmed appropriate antibiotic management. The patient continued to remain clinically stable.
Fig. 1
 
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in a patient with suspected gastroenteritis. Image was obtained within 24 hours of presentation to the hospital. CT demonstrated cholelithiasis but no other abnormality
Viral nasopharyngeal swabs were also positive for human metapneumovirus. The results of fecal nucleic acid testing were negative for other common pathogenic organisms, including enteric viruses, parasites, and bacteria. The results of viral and autoimmune hepatitis screening were negative. Urine culture performed prior to initiating antibiotics was clear. Blood film obtained 48 hours after admission showed neutrophilic toxic changes.
On the third day after presentation, the patient became visibly jaundiced and complained of mild intermittent epigastric pain. Blood biochemistry showed acute renal and hepatic injury and hyperbilirubinemia suggestive of intravascular hemolysis (Table 1). The patient was urgently transferred to a tertiary center, given the risk of deterioration.
The patient’s condition significantly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was admitted to intensive care with septic shock and renal failure. He required support with multiple inotropes and dialysis. Antibiotic cover was extended to include vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin (Table 2). Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small bowel enteritis, hepatic infarction, and portal vein thrombosis suspected to be septic thromboembolism. CT also demonstrated several hepatic hypodensities consistent with multiple abscesses, the largest measuring 41 mm in diameter (Fig. 2). Ultrasound-guided drainage was performed, and 35 ml of hemoturbid fluid was aspirated. The result of culture of the hepatic abscess was positive for E. avium.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis 72 hours after presentation to the hospital showing multiple lobulated intrahepatic collections, infarction of hepatic segments 5 and 8, and septic occlusion of the portal vein. There were no gas locules associated with the abscesses. CT also demonstrated small bowel enteritis (not shown)
The patient developed refractory septic and cardiogenic shock and required intubation and ventilation. Intubation was complicated by bronchial bleeding that required transfusion and endobronchial intervention. The patient had been temporarily commenced on therapeutic heparin for portal vein thrombosis; however, this was rapidly reversed with Prothrombinex®-VF (CSL Behring, Victoria, Australia) [7]. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (estimated LV ejection fraction, 21%) but no evidence of valvular dysfunction or infective endocarditis. Despite maximal intensive care support, including intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation, the patient died 2 days after admission to intensive care, 6 days after his initial presentation.

"42-year-old woman, overweight (BMI 29.1 kg/m2) who suffered from chronic migraine without aura and migraine with aura once every 1-2 months.
She had a regular menstrual cycle and had been taking a progesterone-only contraceptive for 4-5 years.

With galcanezumab treatment (120 mg per month) for migraine management, she was able to achieve a significant reduction in migraine attacks. However, approximately 1 to 2 weeks after starting treatment, he experienced a loss of libido. Sexual arousal also disappeared completely. As a result, it became nearly impossible for her to experience an orgasm.

Since the patient was certain that the loss of libido was solely due to taking galcanezumab, she did not consult a psychologist or sexologist.

Although he experienced no further side effects with galcanezumab, he decided to switch to erenumab 140 mg every, again once a month. However, erenumab appeared to be less effective as the patient continued to experience daily headaches (triggered by exercise), despite not experiencing any improvement in libido.","Diagnosis:

Medication-induced sexual dysfunction

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: It is quite common for medications used for migraine treatments, particularly monoclonal antibodies like galcanezumab, to have side effects that can impact sexual function. The timeline of symptoms correlating with medication changes supports this diagnosis.

" 17 year old woman, consulted with a two day history of sore throat and blocked nose. Examination revealed an inflamed pharynx with some exudate, but the patient was otherwise well. She had been treated with two consecutive courses of antibiotics for a similar illness in 1997. She was keen to have antibiotics again. After some negotiation a compromise was reached: antibiotics were not prescribed, but a throat swab was taken. A week later the swab result confirmed group A haemolytic streptococcus (non-β) reported as sensitive to penicillin, and a letter with a prescription was sent to Ms D after contact by telephone failed. One week after this the patient complained to the practice manager that she still had a sore throat. Her sister had been seen the day before (by a different doctor) with the same symptoms and was prescribed antibiotics immediately. An appointment to see the doctor concerned to discuss the complaint was made, but the patient failed to attend.
Questions
The throat swab is currently recommended as a diagnostic aid in patients with sore throat.3The quoted sensitivity (26-30%) and specificity (73-80%), however, are low when compared with the “gold standard” of a rise in antistreptolysin O titre.6 The antistreptolysin O titre is probably the best predictor for the presence of group A β haemolytic streptococcus, the most common bacterial pathogen causing sore throat, as the association with definite cases of rheumatic fever and high initial level of antistreptolysin O titre or rise in antistreptolysin O titre is 100%.7 The low predictive value of throat swabs is probably due to a high symptomless carriage rate of group A β haemolytic streptococcus (ranging from 6% to 40%).7 Although antistreptolysin O titre may be a better gold standard, it is not suitable for routine use because of delay, cost, and the inconvenience of serial titres. As the first case illustrates, if the throat culture is positive it is difficult not to prescribe further antibiotics.
What are the benefits and risks of prescribing antibiotics?
The rationale behind treating people with sore throat with antibiotics is to reduce symptoms and the likelihood of developing suppurative and non-suppurative complications.
Symptom relief
The Cochrane review reports that 90% of all (treated and untreated) patients are well one week after the onset of symptoms.2 Those treated with antibiotics for sore throat, headache, and fever have reduced symptoms on day three. The maximum benefit is at three and a half days, when the symptoms of half the treated patients have already settled.
Suppurative complications
Quinsy is rare in general practice.8 Most randomised controlled trials exclude patients at high risk of suppurative complications. Despite these exclusions, the Cochrane review shows that the rate of complication with quinsy is significantly reduced with antibiotics.2 However, this finding is based on a single trial reported in 1951 that contributed 15 of the 19 patients with quinsy in the untreated group.
Non-suppurative complications
Rheumatic fever is similarly rare in general practice. In trials from the 1950s, however, treatment of exudative tonsillitis with penicillin did reduce the incidence of subsequent rheumatic fever.2 Moreover, patients who have developed complications (either suppurative or non-suppurative) may not have had a preceding sore throat, and of those with prior symptoms, only a minority will seek medical help.7,8
Disadvantages of prescribing antibiotics
The risks of prescribing antibiotics have been well described. These include the common side effects of antibiotics (diarrhoea, rashes, candidiasis, unplanned pregnancy secondary to oral contraceptive failure) and the rare occurrence of anaphylaxis. Another consequence is to “medicalise” the condition of sore throat, resulting in increasing reattendance for future episodes of this condition.5Furthermore, there is evidence that by treating patients positive for group A β haemolytic streptococcus, the modest benefits of treatment at the beginning of the episode of illness may be negated because of increased likelihood of such an infection recurring.9When the direct costs of prescribing and the impact on bacterial resistance are also considered, the use of antibiotics is clearly not a risk free strategy.
Using a throat swab as a diagnostic test in primary care may medicalise the condition and encourage prescribing.6 Guidelines from the United States and the United Kingdom recommend prescribing antibiotics in patients in whom group A β haemolytic streptococcus has been identified.10,11 We believe that this advice ignores the fact that no satisfactory diagnostic test can identify these patients.
Very ill patients have, because of exclusion on clinical grounds, been poorly represented in randomised controlled trials.2,4 These patients may be the individuals most likely to benefit from antibiotics. For the vast majority of patients with a sore throat, however, the trade-off between risks and benefits from antibiotics is, at best, marginal.
These diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas ignore the patient’s perspective. In the United Kingdom, most patients consult for reassurance and information; only a minority expect to receive antibiotics. Doctors often prescribe antibiotics to maintain good relationships with their patients. What patients require is consistent information that addresses their concerns and beliefs.12,13 Our cases illustrate that the priority in consultations should be to elicit patients’ concerns and provide sufficient information for a joint management decision to be reached.","Diagnosis:

Acute Pharyngitis due to Group A Streptococcus

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The positive throat swab for group A haemolytic streptococcus supports this diagnosis. Typical symptoms include sore throat, inflamed pharynx with exudate, and blocked nose. Past history of similar illness reinforces this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotics( penicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate), support therapy"
"34-year-old woman presented to the emergency department for evaluation of a 12-hour history of sudden severe epigastric pain and bilateral leg weakness during exercise associated with nausea and vomiting.
 She experienced 2 episodes of diarrhea; 1 of which was blood streaked. The patient reported not eating or drinking much that day. She described a few previous less severe episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea since childhood associated with certain foods. She denied fever or chills but reported a 5-lb intentional weight loss during the past month. She denied changes in her appetite, myalgia, arthralgia, or vision changes. She had no recent travel, sick contacts, or antibiotic drug use. She denied current pregnancy.
The patient was previously healthy; her medical history included recurrent urinary tract infections and infertility, with a previous artificial insemination attempt resulting in a missed abortion. Current medication use includes clomiphene and progesterone vaginal suppository.
At presentation, her vital signs were as follows: body temperature 36.9°C; heart rate 69 beats/min; respiratory rate 16 breaths/min; and blood pressure  98/60 mmHg. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but was in no acute distress. Her abdomen was soft and nondistended, with positive bowel sounds. She had generalized tenderness in all 4 quadrants, with absence of guarding and rebound tenderness. Her mucous membranes appeared dry. Lower extremity strength was normal. Results of a urine pregnancy test obtained on arrival to the emergency department were negative.
The clinical presentation and CT findings suggest colitis. The differential diagnosis for the cause of colitis includes infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic etiologies. Imaging studies are nonspecific and do not differentiate between these etiologies of colitis.
A serum lactate level could refer to either a serum l-lactate or a serum d-lactate level. An elevated serum l-lactate level would indicate either tissue hypoxia (type A lactic acidosis) or decreased clearance of lactic acid, which occurs most commonly with liver disease (type B lactic acidosis). d-Lactate is produced by bacteria in the gut and is metabolized slowly by humans. Patients with short-bowel syndrome can develop lactic acidosis from elevated serum levels of d-lactate. An elevated serum lactate level would not confirm the diagnosis of colitis or clarify the underlying etiology.


Endoscopy is the preferred method for confirming the diagnosis and cause of colitis. In this patient, flexible sigmoidoscopy would not allow visualization of the affected areas of bowel; therefore, colonoscopy is the best test to confirm the diagnosis.
Mesenteric angiography would not be the next step in the evaluation of colitis. It may play a role in the evaluation of ischemic colitis if there is isolated right-sided colonic involvement (possible superior mesenteric artery occlusion) or if there is a question as to whether a patient has mesenteric ischemia or colonic ischemia.
A colonoscopy was performed next and showed areas of irregular erosion and ulceration starting at the splenic flexure and involving the distal colon. The mucosa in the distal ileum, as well as the cecum; ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon; and rectum, appeared normal. A biopsy of the area of segmental colitis showed edema and hemorrhage in the lamina propria and superficial epithelial necrosis.
In patients with findings of colitis on CT, stool antimicrobial assessment (including Clostridium difficile toxin testing) to assess for infectious colitis is often completed before proceeding with colonoscopy. In this case, stool antimicrobial assessment was initiated but not completed before colonoscopy. The patients ongoing abdominal pain and the distribution of colonic lesions on CT, which raised concern for skip lesions of Crohn disease, led to the pursuit of early colonoscopy. Stool assessment ultimately revealed few fecal leukocytes and a negative polymerase chain reaction result for Shiga toxin. The stool cultures for enteric pathogens were negative for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Aeromonas.
In ulcerative colitis, one would expect to see mucosal disease (erythema, edema, hemorrhage, or ulceration) starting at the rectum and extending proximally. Biopsy findings would include diffuse crypt architectural irregularity and reduced crypt numbers.5,6 The rectal mucosa was not involved in this case, making ulcerative colitis unlikely. Crohn disease could account for the colonic and distal ileal involvement seen on CT; however, on a colonoscopy one would expect to see a cobblestone pattern of ulcerations enclosing islands of normal mucosa.5 Biopsy findings would include granulomas and focal or patchy inflammation.6
Transient ischemic colitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The scattered erosions and ulcerations seen on the colonoscopy, combined with the biopsy findings of superficial mucosal edema, hemorrhage, and epithelial necrosis, are classic.7 Other findings on the colonoscopy in ischemic colitis include edematous and fragile mucosa, scattered erythema, purple hemorrhagic nodules, and sharp demarcation of the area of involved bowel. In severe forms of ischemic colitis, the mucosa appears cyanotic, and pseudomembranes, pseudopolyps, and pseudotumors may be seen. In gangrenous ischemic colitis, bluish-black mucosal nodules may be present.8
The clinical suspicion for infectious colitis was low in this case because the patient had no recent travel or dietary history to suggest exposure to enteric pathogens. Furthermore, results of stool studies were negative. The patient was treated supportively for a diagnosis of transient ischemic colitis based on her colonoscopy and clinical presentation. Her abdominal pain resolved, and she continued to remain free of recurrence of diarrhea or GI bleeding. She did not experience any recurrent lower extremity weakness with ambulation.
The right colon is infrequently involved in ischemic colitis. It most commonly involves watershed areas of the bowel, such as the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction.8In one series, the splenic flexure was involved in 57% of patients, and the sigmoid and rectum were involved in 9%.9 Involvement of the left colon (80%) is much more common than that of the right colon (4.7%).8
The most common presenting symptoms of ischemic colitis include abdominal pain (49%-78%), GI bleeding (62%-77%), and diarrhea (33%-38%).8,9 Age is a risk factor for ischemic colitis, with elderly patients being at a higher risk than young, healthy patients. In addition, females are at higher risk for ischemic colitis than are males. Other risk factors include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, constipation, and the use of predisposing medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, antihypertensives, laxatives, oral contraceptives, and anticonvulsants).1,2,8-10 Hypotension and hypovolemia, not cardiac thromboembolism, are the most common mechanisms by which ischemic colitis occurs.2
This patients clinical presentation with abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and diarrhea is consistent with a typical case of ischemic colitis. Her young age, lack of comorbid disease, and absence of predisposing medication use, however, make her case atypical. She was at risk for hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake and exercise when her symptoms developed, and she was hypotensive at presentation. Her hypotension and hypovolemia were treated by intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline on hospital admission. The hypotension responded to fluid rehydration, with no further recurrence during hospitalization.
Most cases of ischemic colitis are of a mild form (transient ischemic colitis) that resolves with supportive measures, including intravenous hydration, hemodynamic stabilization, discontinuation of offending medications, bowel rest, and antibiotic drug therapy.2,4 It can be difficult on initial presentation to distinguish mild forms of ischemic colitis from severe forms that may require surgical intervention. One risk factor for more severe disease associated with worse outcomes is right-sided colonic involvement.11
Eighteen percent of patients develop chronic ischemic colitis.11 They may experience diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, or GI bleeding, and their disease may progress to stricture formation or gangrene.4 Malnutrition from protein-losing enteropathy and symptomatic stricture are indications for surgical intervention in patients with chronic ischemic colitis.2
The role of hypercoagulable states in the pathogenesis of ischemic colitis is unclear. There is no evidence that diagnosing and treating a hypercoagulable state in a patient with an initial episode of colonic ischemia is beneficial.
This young woman was treated conservatively with intravenous fluids and morphine. She was counseled regarding the importance of maintaining adequate hydration before, during, and after exercise. She was discharged from the hospital and did not report recurrence of abdominal pain or bloody diarrhea during 1-year follow-up.","Diagnosis:

Transient Ischemic Colitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate to high
* Rationale: The scattered erosions and ulcerations observed during the colonoscopy, coupled with biopsy findings of superficial mucosal edema, hemorrhage, and epithelial necrosis, are classic for ischemic colitis. The patients presentation of sudden severe epigastric pain, GI bleeding, and diarrhea is consistent with ischemic colitis. Although the patient is relatively young and lacks significant comorbidities, her hypotension and hypovolemia related to poor oral intake and exercise increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Fluids challenge, antibiotics, support therapy"
"A 51-year-old Chinese woman, who had a past medical history of end stage renal failure, parathyroidectomy, hemithyroidectomy, was admitted in June 2015 for acute abdomen and shock.
Upon initial assessment, she was found to have tachycardia, borderline blood pressure, confusion and abdominal peritoneal signs.
Her white cell count was 16.1x103/uL (neutrophils 85.1%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 16 mm/h. The results of chemistry studies included a total bilirubin of 1.67 mg/dL with direct bilirubin 0.62 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 610 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase of 193 IU/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase of 275 IU/L. At presentation, her clotting profile was normal.
Emergency ultrasound revealed a gallbladder filled with hyperechoic substances. Gallbladder wall was thickened with hypervascularity. Sonographic Murphys sign was positive. Low-level internal echoes were present within the ascitic fluid in the pelvis and the Morrisons pouch (Fig. 1).
 
Fig. 1. Grayscale ultrasound (left) and power doppler ultrasound (right). Echogenic substances represent hemobilia (asterisk).
Immediate contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed. It confirmed hemoperitoneum and distended gallbladder filled with blood and perforation at its fundus. Active contrast extravasation was noted at its wall. Hypodense filling defects inside the gallbladder may represent polypoid growth. Overall finding could be due to acalculous cholecystitis or underlying gallbladder tumor with hemorrhage.
Patient was arranged for emergency embolization. With retrograde right femoral approach, SMA angiogram showed a replaced right hepatic artery from superior mesenteric artery, with active contrast extravasation from the cystic artery of the gallbladder. Celiac angiogram showed no supply to bleeders. Superselective catheterization of the cystic artery was achieved, followed by embolization using particles and coils to the main supplying branch and main cystic artery (Fig. 3).
In order to tide over the acute episode, our interventional radiologist offered percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy to the patient, using a 7Fr single-step drainage catheter with ultrasound guidance. Blood clot was removed by manual aspiration. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparotomy and cholecystostomy on the following day. Pathology report of the specimen confirmed acute on chronic inflammation with hemorrhagic necrosis and incidental note of gallbladder polyps.
 
Fig. 2. (a) (left). Noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen shows hemobilia. (b) (right). Contrast-enhanced arterial phase CT scan shows a bright focus (arrowhead) which refers to the site of active contrast extravasation on the lateral gallbladder wall.

Post procedural digital subtraction angiography demonstrates multiple microcoils (arrowhead) within the proximal cystic artery, with complete occlusion of the artery and nonopacification of the distal part.
After hemodynamic stabilization, for patients who are not surgical candidates, a cholecystostomy is an option. There was a report of hemorrhagic cholecystitis treated with a cholecystostomy and urokinase therapy [11]. Urgent percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy was undertaken in our case using a 7 Fr single-step drainage catheter with ultrasound guidance and blood clots were aspirated. It was followed by cholecystectomyon the ensuing day. In summary, hemorrhagic cholecystitis is rare but its fatal complications are not rare. The condition warrants a high index of suspicion.","Diagnosis:

"51-year-old man was transferred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, complaining of watery diarrhea and bloody stools for the past 12 hours and abdominal pain along with shortness of breath for the past 4 hours.
Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient consumed large quantities of suspected contaminated food. Twelve hours before admission, the patient began to develop watery diarrhea alternating with bloody stools, with a total volume of about 500 mL, accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. Eight hours later, the patient developed abdominal pain, accompanied by shortness of breath, pallor and sweating with no complaints of fever and chills.
The patient had a previous medical history of hypertension and gout over ten years but was poorly compliant to medical treatment. His surgical history was nonsignificant. He had a twenty pack-year history of drinking and denied any other specific personal or family history of other diseases.
Physical examination upon admission revealed a temperature of 36 °C, tachycardia at 102 bpm, tachypnea with RR of 40/m and hypotensive shock with blood pressure at 59/38 mmHg. The patient was somnolent and poorly responsive. Both lungs were covered with rales and phlegm sounds on auscultation. The abdomen was distended and slight tensed, tenderness and rebound tenderness were not elicited due to comatose state of the patient. No other pathological signs were noted.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (17.72×10E9cells/L) with predominantly neutrophils (94%), mild anemia (94 g/L) and a normal platelet count (173×10E9 cells/L). Liver and renal function tests showed elevated transaminases (ALT 1,999 U/L and AST 3,099 U/L), serum creatinine (213 µmol/L), serum uric acid (503 µmol/L), serum potassium (6.65 mmol/L) and a decreased albumin (26.9 g/L). Serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were increased at 554 mg/L and greater than 100 ng/mL respectively. Arterial-blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed acidosis (pH 7.2), normocapnia (pCO2 32.8 mmHg) and hypoxemia (pO229.9mmHg) with hyperlactemia (lactate concentration 13.5 mmol/L). On admission, a Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral pneumonia with consolidation in the upper lobe of the right lung (Figure 1A). The abdominal CT scan revealed diffuse peritonitis and marked edema with thickening of the small intestinal walls (Figure 1B,C).
 
Figure 1 Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the patient. (A) Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pneumonia with consolidation in upper lobe of the right lung and air bronchogram sign; (B) contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan showed diffuse peritonitis and marked edema of the small intestine with significant enhancement of the intestinal wall; (C) coronal reconstruction of abdominal CT showed thickening and edema of the intestine; (D) bedside chest radiography showed significant improvement of the upper lobe of the right lung.
The patient who presented with respiratory failure, hyperkalemia and septic shock, was immediately started on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, aggressive fluid resuscitation with vasopressors dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and drotaverine to relieve gastrointestinal cramps. Initial diagnosis of severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and acute severe gastroenteritis was based on the clinical findings including patient history, symptoms and work-up findings. Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with meropenem 2 g TID, tigecycline 100 mg BID and moxifloxacin 0.4 g QD was administered. Hydrocortisone 0.1 g TID was injected to reduce the inflammatory response. In addition, high-dose gamma globulin was given to boost immunity along with human serum albumin, hepatoprotective treatment and nutrition support. On October 24, 2018, we initiated ventilator weaning protocols when inflammatory indices and ABG values of the patient significantly improved and bedside chest X-rays showed significant improvement (Figure 1D). On October 24, 2018 diarrhea recurred with a daily volume of 500–1,000 mL. Sputum and blood cultures were negative, but urine and stool cultures were positive for Candida albicans. Intravenous antifungal therapy with caspofungin 500 mg QD was administered. On October 27, 2018, gastrointestinal hemorrhage recurred as hematochezia and hematemesis, with a total volume of 2,000 mL. After failure of conservative treatment, a laparotomy was finally performed revealing multisegmental bowel necrosis from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum with severe congestion and dark purple appearance and multiple mesenteric ulcer and abscesses, rupture of the small intestine 70 cm proximal to the ileocecum. The necrotic bowel was then resected (Figure 2). Histopathological examination of the resected bowel showed extensive inflammation and necrosis of the mucosa, partial intestinal wall full-thickness necrosis, subserosal hemorrhage and fibrinoid vascular necrosis accompanied by endovascular thrombosis, with large-scale local infiltration of neutrophils, suggestive of AHNE (Figure 3). The final diagnosis of the presented case was AHNE. On November 2, 2018, the patient developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding (about 3,000 mL), prompting a second emergency laparotomy for hemostasis. The patient postoperatively developed necrosis at the incision site which complicated with infection (Figure 2D). He unfortunately died of the disease on December 3, 2018 following repeated bouts of hemorrhage and infection despite active medical treatment and multiple surgical interventions (for details of the course, see Figure 4). All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013). The patient and his legal guardian provided informed written consent for publication of this study and any accompanying images during the treatment.
 
Figure 2 Operative picture of the patient. (A) Laparotomy revealed multisegmental bowel necrosis from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum with severe congestion, edema and dark purple appearance; rupture of the small intestine 70 cm proximal to the ileocecum was visible (see the arrow); (B) multiple mesenteric ulcer and abscesses were visible (see the arrow); (C) the lesions were segmentally distributed and involved the serosa; transmural necrosis and hemorrhage were visible; (D) post-operative incision site necrosis complicated with infection.","Diagnosis:

Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Enteropathy

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The patient presented with severe gastrointestinal symptoms (watery diarrhea, bloody stools, abdominal pain) consistent with enteritis. CT scan findings of diffuse peritonitis and thickening of the small intestinal walls, along with histopathological evidence of multisegmental bowel necrosis and extensive inflammation, confirm AHNE.

Suitable Treatments:
* fluid challenge, vasoconstrictor, antibiotics, support therapy, surgery"
"43-year-old nonsmoking female with a past medical history of Marfan syndrome, Mitral valve prolapse, and a 4.0 cm dilated ascending aorta who presented to her cardiologist after being diagnosed with an abdominal aortic dissection.
 The patient noted that the left side of her abdomen protruded more when standing compared to the right. She denied associated abdominal, chest, or back pain. The patient was told that she may have a hernia in the past.
Because she was concerned about the asymmetry of her abdomen, she ordered an abdominal CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast which showed a 5.5 cm abdominal aortic dissection. The patient was reluctant to go to the hospital until she saw her cardiologist a few days later, who recommended hospitalization and a consult for cardiothoracic surgery.
Interestingly, when the patient was seen in the hospital, she again denied chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. She only mentioned that her left side of the abdomen protrudes more than the right side when standing. On physical exam, patient had several features typical to Marfan sindrome: she was tall, had a high arched palate, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum, and her arm span was greater than her height. Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, had normal bowel sounds, and no pulsatile mass was appreciated. However, when the patient stood up, it was clear that the left side of her abdomen was bulging out in comparison to the right. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a dissecting aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to 5.6 cm (Figure 1); the false lumen supplied the left common iliac artery and the true lumen supplied the right common iliac artery. There was no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.

 

Figure 1
CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast demonstrating dissection of the abdominal aorta.
The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on a nitroglycerin drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and recommended the patient to undergo open surgical repair of the abdominal aortic dissection. In order to risk stratify the patient prior to the procedure, the patient underwent a regadenoson nuclear medicine stress test, which was low risk for ischemia. The patient underwent successful repair of her abdominal aortic dissection via a minimally invasive open retroperitoneal approach. She tolerated the procedure well without postoperative complications.
The patient came into the hospital with no home medications. As she has reported in the past, she was tried on nebivolol but had failed it due to syncope. Given this, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID was started cautiously to provide long-term benefits for the patients abdominal and thoracic aorta. The patient tolerated this medication well and was safely discharged home with close cardiovascular follow-up.","Diagnosis:

Abdominal Aortic Dissection

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Extremely High
* Rationale: Confirmed by CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis. The patients history of Marfan syndrome increases the risk of aortic dissections. Despite the lack of pain, other signs and imaging support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* surgery, support therapy"
"53-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension who was taking no medications was in his usual state of health 3 days ago before developing a sudden onset of right lower quadrant pain.
The pain was described as continuous, sharp, 8/10 in intensity, radiating down to the right leg, aggravating with any body movement and decreasing with rest. Pain was also once associated with non-bloody vomiting. The patient went to see his primary care physician who referred him to the hospital for evaluation of possible appendicitis. Initially, appendicitis was suspected since the patient had severe right lower quadrant pain, rebound tenderness, episodes of anorexia, nausea/vomiting and leucocytosis. Before admission to the hospital, the patient was taking Motrin with minimal relief for the last 3 days. On arrival, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. He had a blood pressure (BP) of 241/151 mm Hg, heart rate 101 bpm, respiratory rate was 18/m, blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) of 97% on room air, body temperature 37.4 °C.
On examination, abdomen was soft, with moderate right lower quadrant tenderness. Voluntary guarding, mild rebound and Rovsing’s sign were positive. His right leg showed weakly palpable pulse in popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedic artery.
Laboratory results displayed elevated white cell count (WCC) 21.2x109/L with 79 neutrophils. Thus, he received 20 mg intravenous labetalol which improved his BP to 178/100 mm Hg. His ECG was normal. A chest X-ray was done to rule out right lower lobe pneumonia, perforation and a search for free air below the diaphragm. The chest X-ray showed prominent aortic arch without cardiomegaly. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to rule out appendicitis which showed AD in descending aorta without rupture. When the AD was seen, thoracic CT scan was added with additional 25 cc of contrast which displayed sparing of ascending and arch of aorta (figure 1).

 

Figure 1
CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast: (A) displays CT of the chest with contrast. Descending aortic aneurysm originates just distal to the left subclavian artery. There is no evidence of involvement of the great vessels of the aortic arch. (B–D) show CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Aortic dissection is noted extending from the thoracic aorta, through the abdominal aorta into the bilateral external iliac arteries. Arrows pointing to dissection flap at the edge of the aorta.
The patient’s BP increased again to 184/101 mm Hg, and thus esmolol drip was initiated, and he was admitted to the intensive care unit for closer haemodynamic monitoring. His BP remained elevated, so nicardipine drip was also started. The therapeutic goal of BP was to remain below 120/80 mm Hg. Medical management was recommended for the patient.
Meanwhile, secondary causes of hypertension were also investigated, and the work-up for thyroid-stimulating hormone, plasma renin, aldosterone, metanephrine, cortisol, toxicology were normal. An ultrasound Doppler of the kidney displayed mild renal artery stenosis. Creatinine was normal, and echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction, grade II diastolic dysfunction and moderate aortic regurgitation.
Based on patient’s history and physicals including onset and location of pain and elevated WCC, differential diagnosis was broadened to include acute appendicitis, acute ureteric colic/urinary tract infection, severe gastroenteritis, small bowel obstruction, terminal ileitis, malignancy, incarcerated or strangulated femoral hernia, and psoas abscess. The diagnosis was made by a combination of clinical suspicion, vitals and CT scan.","Diagnosis:

Aortic Dissection

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The CT scan findings confirmed aortic dissection extending from the thoracic aorta through the abdominal aorta into the bilateral external iliac arteries. Clinical presentation of severe hypertension, right lower quadrant pain, elevated WCC, and imaging findings are consistent with AD.

"58‐year‐old man presented at the emergency room with a two‐day history of headache, sore throat, cough, and fever.
He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media.
 He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn (Figure 1). He had bacterial meningitis 6 years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75 mm Hg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils size was 4 mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae(see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes (Figure 4). Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates (Figure 4). Unfortunately, on the fifth day of admission, his physical examination continued to show GCS of 3 out of 15, and brainstem reflexes were absent. A brain perfusion scan showed no brain perfusion, and he was declared brain dead.
NB
Our patients history of chronic otitis media with mastoiditis was possibly the most important factor of the recurrent severe bacterial meningitis. Otitis media have many serious complications, including mastoiditis, labyrinthitis, seventh cranial nerve palsy, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, and cerebral venous thrombosis. 6 Acute bacterial meningitis is a devastating complication of otitis media with a reported mortality rate of 41% and chronic otitis media was the cause in 74% of the morality cases.

Bacterial Meningitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The patient has a history of chronic otitis media, which is a common risk factor for bacterial meningitis. The patient also presents with the classic symptoms of bacterial meningitis, including headache, fever, stiff neck, and altered mental status. The CSF examination confirms the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, as it shows a high white blood cell count, elevated protein levels, and decreased glucose levels. The CSF culture also isolates Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a common cause of bacterial meningitis.

"By A 55-year-old female patient was admitted to a peripheral hospital and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis due to salmonella.
Her stay was complicated by bacterial meningitis based on clinical symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9, and positive meningismus signs. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further management where the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was confirmed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis from a lumbar puncture (LP) that showed (WBC) 35,811/mic liter; neutrophils 85 %; protein 383 mg/dl; glucose 103 mg/dl. CSF PCR revealed Streptococcus pneumonia. Unenhanced CT-brain showed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where she was intubated and started on cefepime 2 g IV Q8h, vancomycin 1 g IV Q12h and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV 12 hourly. On day 3, the patient had two episodes of high-grade fever of 39.4 °C with generalized seizures and deterioration in mental status so there was an escalation in antibiotics and was put on valproic acid 1 g IV 12 hourly. The patient improved clinically in the next few days and was extubated in the ICU. Blood cultures showed no bacterial growth with mildly elevated CRP and WBC on blood analysis.
On day 9, the patient started complaining of dizziness and headache. On day 14, the patient suddenly developed generalized weakness. Neurological examination showed left proportional hemiplegia. MRI brain showed an area of restricted diffusion with no corresponding enhancement in the right pons which may denote a sub-acute ischemic lesion (Fig. 1).
 

Fig. 1. Diffusion-weighted sequence shows an area of restricted diffusion in the right pons, as evidenced by the high signal intensity of the lesion. (Black arrow).
Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) revealed no evidence of endocarditis; hence, septic emboli were ruled out as a possible cause of the ischemic stroke. On day 16, CT brain without contrast was compared to the previous MRI examination and showed an area of hypodensity in the pons confirming a subacute ischemic stroke (Fig. 2). The patient was still febrile (38.1 °C). A second lumbar puncture (LP) showed clear CSF: CSF white blood cells (WBC) 437/ mic liter; neutrophils 60 %; CSF protein 149 mg/dl; CSF glucose 55 mg/dl. CSF PCR was negative for streptococcus pneumonia. Screening for other infections was negative. On day 18, no improvement was noted and the patient’s level of consciousness was decreasing with a GCS score of 4, generalized seizures and recurrent episodes of high-grade fever for which the patient was reintubated. EEG was negative for sub-clinical seizures. Blood cultures were negative for nocardia. HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody enzyme immunoassay screening was negative. CSF Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) smear was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CSF PCR was also negative for tuberculosis and other possible infectious agents. In the ICU, the patient’s symptoms have totally resolved after administration of dexamethasone 8 mg IV Q8h for 3 days. For this reason, a non-infectious inflammatory process was suspected. Immunology testing was positive for Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA) and cryoglobulins and negative for P-ANCA and C-ANCA. A second MRI brain revealed new restricted diffusion areas in both thalami more prominent on the left side denoting acute ischemic lesions (Fig. 3). Another TEE showed no vegetations, hence, absence of any source of septic emboli. Atrial fibrillationwas also ruled out as another source of septic emboli by using a cardiac Holter monitor. On day 25, the patient had no more episodes of fever. She improved over the coming days and was discharged home with a GCS of 14. The patient was put on oral Prednisone 20 mg 12 hourly for one week followed by a dosage of 10 mg TID for an additional week. The patient also was prescribed Vancomycin 1 g IV Q12h and Cefepime 2 g IV Q8h for one week. The patient exhibited upon discharge sustained consciousness, articulate verbal communication, and the capacity for autonomous meal intake. Motor evaluation demonstrated significant improvement with mild weakness on the left side. Notably, the patient was discharged utilizing a wheelchair as the primary means of mobility. A structured rehabilitation plan, featuring daily physiotherapy sessions, was promptly implemented to address ambulatory limitations. The rehabilitation regimen concentrates on gait training, balance refinement, and muscular strength development. MRI brain 1 month after discharge showed features of normal ischemic changes translated by reduced sequence abnormality on FLAIR and DW (Fig. 4). Following four months of rehabilitation, left sided weakness has totally resolved.

"The patient (56 years old) presented herself in a hospital with drowsiness, dizziness, cognitive impairment and severe recurrent episodic headaches. Symptoms had started two days earlier. She had previously been admitted to the same hospital for cholangitis and chronic lumbar syndrome exacerbated by opioid addiction. On that occasion, pain therapy had been modified to switch from oxycodone and morphine to buprenorphine; she had also been prescribed duloxetine prior to discharge. Results and course Patient in good cardiopulmonary compensation; Neurological state in the normae; Elevated systolic blood pressure (170 mmHg) with unknown hypertension. Since the patient had reported being treated concomitantly with oxycodone, morphine and buprenorphine, the symptoms were initially interpreted as the result of opioid intoxication. One day after hospitalization, the dizziness had disappeared. However, for two days there were also severe headaches, with a duration of about 3-4 hours, which did not respond to analgesics (paracetamol and metamizole, in addition to the aforementioned opiates). According to the authors, the headache was different from the well-known migraine with aura. The woman had also reported taking rizatriptan for several days. Cerebral CT to rule out an intracranial hemorrhage had not yielded significant results. During the stay the patient again developed fluctuating neurological deficits including a perceptual disorder of the left side of the body, a loss of tone of the extremities on the left side, intermittent and rotational dizziness, and cognitive slowdown. The suspected initial diagnoses were: dissociative disorder or new migraine with aura. Further analysis showed: Cerebral MRI: recent but already delimited cerebral ischemia in multiple areas of flow; presence of two short-extension stenosis in the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and one short-extension stenosis in the posterior cerebral artery. Echodoppler: Mild atheromatosis of the extracranial vessels supplying the brain and several segmental accelerations of intracranial flow in the right ACA, the middle cerebral artery on both sides and the ACA on both sides. Results of CSF and serological screening for vasculitis: not significant. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography: no evidence of cardiac-derived embolism. Final diagnosis and discussion According to the authors, the symptoms were compatible with RCVS, taking into account the absence of enhancement of the wall of the basal cerebral arteries on MRI with black blood sequences with contrast medium. Approximately three weeks later, this diagnostic suspicion was confirmed as the diffuse acceleration of the segmental intracerebral flow initially present in a transcranial echoDoppler was almost completely regressed on both sides. RCVS is a rare but still plausible cause of stroke; it must be clarified immediately to reduce the morbidity and mortality of those affected and to avoid unnecessary or dangerous treatments, the authors point out. Initially, about 10% of patients have transient focal neurological deficits. Visual impairments are the most common followed least frequently by sensory, dysphasic or motor deficits. Physical examination is normal in most cases or shows various fluctuating symptoms. Women are affected more frequently than men. In addition to transient focal neurological deficits, early complications of RCVS include pressure and epileptic seizures; other complications include ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most important differential diagnosis is primary central nervous system vasculitis (PACNS). In this case, unlike RCVS, men are more frequently affected; headache is more insidious and continuous, without associated substance use or monophasic progression. Cognitive deficits are typical, such as confusion and a slow development of dementia. CSF results are generally pathological with lymphomonocyte pleocytosis (usually < 20, rarely > 100 cells) and elevated total protein (usually < 120 mg/dl). Magnetic resonance imaging shows diffuse lesions of the gray and white matter of different ages; hemorrhages are a rarity in PACNS. Angiography is not able to differentiate the two diseases, but the angiographic normalization of the results after intra-arterial administration of nimodipine is indicative of the RCVS.","Diagnosis:

Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients symptoms, including severe recurrent episodic headaches, fluctuating neurological deficits, and recent cerebral ischemia observed on MRI, are indicative of RCVS. The absence of vasculitis indicators on CSF and serological screening, and the regression of segmental intracerebral flow accelerations in follow-up imaging, further support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Fluids will be administered intravenously and migraine treatments such as aspirin or Depakote may be given"
"A 21-year-old woman, with no probable previous ones, showed up in the emergency room with a worsening of her general condition, severe shortness of breath, dizziness and bilateral paresthesias at the extremities. The patient stated that she had occasionally consumed nitrous oxide in recent years, but in the four months prior to the symptomatic onset she had consumed increasing amounts of it. In the 5 weeks prior to the emergency room visit, he had consumed 3600 to 7200 grams per day (6 to 12 cylinders of nitrous oxide, about 600 g of nitrous oxide per cylinder). According to the authors, this amount corresponds to a daily anesthesia with nitrous oxide of about 10-20 hours (with 50% nitrous oxide and a respiratory volume/minute of 6 L). The patient did not smoke, had no history of thrombosis and had been taking oral contraceptives for several years. The first results The first results showed: Absence of focal neurological deficits; Tachycardia (130 beats/min); Need for oxygen (6 liters); Systolic blood pressure between 90 and 110 mmHg. Among the initial differential diagnoses, doctors list: pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and a previously undiagnosed tumor.
From subsequent exams: Electrocardiography: signs of overload of the right ventricle; Computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries: cavalry pulmonary embolism (PE) with signs of overload of the right ventricle (the cavalry EP occurs when a large thrombus settles at the point where the main pulmonary artery branches off in the shape of a Y-shape and out of each lung). Laboratory tests also show increased values of: Troponin T, 50 ng/L (reference value <15 ng/L); Type B natriuretic propeptide (pro-BNP) 4600 ng/L (reference value <300 ng/L); Homocysteine, 78 mmol/L (reference value <15 mmol/L); Vitamin B12, 500 pmol/L (within the reference range). Progression and further results On the second day of hospitalization, the patient continued to be confused and weak. The neurological conditions had worsened and a subsequent CT of the brain (on the third day of hospitalization) revealed a recent central central cerebral infarction. An echocardiogram showed a dilated right ventricle with a thrombus in the right ventricle and a right-to-left shunt at the atrial level. Brain MRI on day 4 revealed a thrombosis of the basilar artery and confirmed the presence of extensive ischemic infarctions of the left hemisphere. According to the authors, laboratory tests for coagulation disorders and thrombophilia have been performed several times. Overall, the tests did not reveal the presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies and IgG, IgM or IgA type beta-2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies. Anticoagulant lupus tested negative, as did tests for hereditary thrombophilia. A genetic analysis of the polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) revealed a homozygosis for the MTHFR 1286 A>C variant, which can lead to slightly elevated homocysteine levels. Other possible causes of thrombosis, such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, have been considered but excluded. Several radiological and blood tests have also made it possible to rule out a malignant pathology. Therapy and subsequent course The patient was initially treated with low molecular weight heparin and oral vitamin B12 and hospitalized in preparation for thrombolysis. However, due to the identification of cerebral infarction, thrombolysis was considered contraindicated. The thrombus was then removed mechanically (pulmonary endovascular thrombectomy). The patient continued to receive heparin infusions and in the meantime additional thrombosis was detected in the left and right leg and the iliac artery (right), to which was added a diagnosis of a spleen and kidney infarction. Basic artery thrombosis detected on resonance was also treated with an intracranial endovascular thrombectomy. The patients condition gradually improved even though she was forced into a wheelchair with dysphagia and paresis of the peripheral nerves. After 14 days of stay she was transferred to a neurorehabilitation centre.","Diagnosis:

Pulmonary Embolism

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The presence of signs of right ventricle overload on electrocardiography, CT confirmation of massive pulmonary embolism, elevated troponin T, and pro-BNP levels all support a diagnosis of PE. Additionally, the patients high homocysteine level likely contributed to hypercoagulability, increasing PE risk. The severe shortness of breath, tachycardia, and requirement for supplemental oxygen also align with PE symptoms.

Suitable Treatments:
* Anticoagulants
* Also described as blood thinners, these medicines decrease the ability of the blood to clot
* This helps stop a clot from getting bigger and keep new clots from forming
* Examples include warfarin and heparin
* Fibrinolytic therapy
* Also called clot busters, these medicines are given intravenously (IV or into a vein) to break down the clot
* These medicines are only used in life-threatening situations
* Vena cava filter
* A small metal device placed in the vena cava (the large blood vessel that returns blood from the body to the heart) may be used to keep clots from traveling to the lungs
* These filters are generally used when you cant get anticoagulation treatment (for medical reasons), develop more clots even with anticoagulation treatment, or when you have bleeding problems from anticoagulation medicines
* Pulmonary embolectomy
* Rarely used, this is surgery done to remove a PE
* It is generally done only in severe cases when your PE is very large, you cant get anticoagulation and/or thrombolytic therapy due to other medical problems or you havent responded well to those treatments, or your condition is unstable
* Percutaneous thrombectomy
* A long, thin, hollow tube (catheter) can be threaded through the blood vessel to the site of the embolism guided by X-ray
* Once the catheter is in place, its used to break up the embolism, pull it out, or dissolve it using thrombolytic medicine"
"65 year old man presented to the emergency department after a collapse at home. There had been no preceding symptoms or illness. He had a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, gout and acne rosacea and his drugs comprised digoxin, aspirin, omeprazole and oxytetracycline. He did not receive warfarin.

On initial assessment he was shocked with cool peripheries and hypotension, in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 90 and a blood pressure of 80/40 mm Hg. He was apyrexial with no evidence of cardiac failure and no complaints of chest pain. He had mild, diffuse tenderness at his epigastrium but no peritonism. There was no evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss.

Routine blood investigations showed a raised white cell count at 16.0×109/l and normal haemoglobin of 12.6 g/dl. Venous blood gas analysis showed a lactate level of 5.4 mmol/l but was otherwise unremarkable.

He received 3 litres of 0.9% NaCl over the next 2 h with no improvement in his haemodynamic profile. He then rapidly deteriorated with severe abdominal pain and increasing agitation. A plan to obtain an abdominal CT scan was abandoned owing to haemodynamic instability and agitation. An abdominal ultrasound scan in the resuscitation room showed minimal free fluid and no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or solid organ abnormality. Treatment was started with an adrenaline infusion and he underwent rapid sequence induction and intubation in the emergency department. After resuscitation from a brief pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest he was transferred to theatre for an emergency laparotomy. On arrival in theatre he had a profound metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.527 (hydrogen ion 313 nmol/l), base excess (BE) −34.2 mmol/l and lactate 15.6 mmol/l, see figure 1. At this point he had a blood pressure of 58/32 mm Hg, heart rate 150 bpm, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) 90% on fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.98 and core temperature of 34°C. He continued with an adrenaline infusion.

Figure 1 serial arterial blood gas
Laparotomy showed marked bleeding from the distal splenic artery. This was ligated and a splenectomy was performed, although the spleen itself appeared to be intact. After this the brisk bleeding settled and the abdomen was closed with drains remaining in situ. The patient required 10 units of packed red cells, 8 units of fresh frozen plasma and two pools of platelets in the perioperative period. By the end of surgery his arterial pH was 6.989, BE −24.1 mmol/l and lactate 11.5 mmol/l

Standard quality control and calibration tests were carried out on the blood gas analyser used in this case and no problems were detected. In particular, the blood gas analyser was used to carry out calibrations at 12:00—4 min before the first theatre sample, and again at 12:33, both of which were satisfactory. It also underwent a quality control run at 08:01 that day and again later in the day at 20:01, which were also satisfactory.

Tight regulation of pH in extracellular fluid is essential for normal cellular function. A normal pH is generally described as being between 7.36 and 7.44 and physiology textbooks would describe a pH outside the range 7.00–7.70 as being incompatible with life.1

The patient in this case developed a profound metabolic acidosis due to a major imbalance between tissue oxygen supply and demand, which was compounded by his cardiac arrest.","Diagnosis:

Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Immediate (Emergency)
* Rationale: The sudden collapse, severe abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate, and past history of atrial fibrillation are highly suggestive of mesenteric ischemia. The absence of gastrointestinal blood loss and the diffuse epigastric tenderness without peritonism further support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Sodium citrate if you have kidney disease or kidney failure
* Fluids delivered through a vein in your arm (IV fluids)
* IV sodium bicarbonate, which helps balance the acids in your blood
* Insulin if you have diabetes-related acidosis"
"86-year-old woman was brought to the emergency room with tachypnea, mental confusion, and cerebral ataxia. She had history of chronic renal failure and perforated peptic ulcer, and had undergone oversew perforation, and gastro- jejunostomy for subsequent intestinal obstruction 1 year ago. She had regularly taken Biofermin supplements (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus) and mulberry juice mixed with sugar and honey during the previous 3 days. She denied taking any toxins. On examination she was malnourished. Her blood 42/min, and body temperature 36.81C. An abdominal X-ray showed distended intestinal loops. A computed tomography scan of the brain was normal. The pertinent laboratory findings on arrival are shown in Table 1. Emergent hemodialysis was performed due to severe metabolic acidosis refractory to intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Her tachypnea and neurological symptoms dramatically improved after hemodialysis.","Diagnosis:

Metabolic Acidosis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with tachypnea and mental confusion, which are classic signs of metabolic acidosis. The laboratory findings likely show abnormalities in electrolyte and bicarbonate levels, and the condition improved dramatically after hemodialysis, indicating the presence of severe metabolic acidosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* supportive measures including intravenous fluids and respiratory support"
"A 57-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our institution with severe muscle weakness, fatigue, and weight loss for the past 2 years. Her medical history included well-controlled migraines and depression, which were treated with sumatriptan and citalopram, respectively. In addition, she had chronic hypokalemia leading to multiple visits to the emergency department for muscle weakness. These episodes were treated with potassium supplementation, with only transient improvement. She denied smoking, drinking alcohol, or using recreational drugs. On further questioning, she complained about dry eyes and dry mouth for the past 5 months. Also, she mentioned unintentional weight loss of 8 pounds during the same time. Upon examination, her vital signs were within acceptable limits. She was cachectic, with marked temporal wasting, dry mouth, and poor dentition. No thrush was noticed. Her cardiopulmonary evaluation was unremarkable, and no organomegaly was palpated. Her neurological examination revealed decreased muscle strength in upper and lower extremities, both proximally and distally. Furthermore, her tendon reflexes were decreased throughout. However, her sensory and vibratory function was intact.

Diagnostic methods
Biochemical studies showed hyperchloremia (122 mEq/L), nonanion gap (non-AG) metabolic acidosis (HCO3−, 16 mEq/L; AG corrected for albumin, 7.8 mEq/L), and severe hypokalemia (2.5 mEq/L). In addition, her serum creatinine (Cr) was 1.3 mg/dl (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 42 ml/min/1.73 m2 per the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula [MDRD]), and her blood urea nitrogen was 16 mg/dl. The remaining electrolytes, including calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, were within normal limits. Her arterial blood gas showed pH 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 26 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen 134 mmHg. Her urine biochemistry revealed specific gravity 1.004, urine osmolality 175 mOsm/L, and pH 7.0. On further evaluation, the patient had a high urine anion gap (UAG) of + 23 and an inappropriately high potassium-to-creatinine ratio (K/Cr) of 3.9 mEq/mg. Repeated urine studies showed persistent alkaline urine (pH range, 6.5–7) with no evidence of glycosuria or phosphaturia. These findings were concerning for dRTA complicated with severe symptomatic hypokalemia. Additionally, her urine sediment was notable for sterile pyuria, as well as the presence of eosinophils, which suggested an ongoing tubulointerstitial process.

She had mild polyclonal gammopathy with predominance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and undetectable IgG4 levels. Furthermore, antinuclear antibody titers (1:1280, speckled pattern), antibodies against Sjögren’s syndrome antigen A (116.4; reference, 0–19.9), and antibodies against Sjögren’s syndrome antigen B (58.3; reference, 19.9) were very high, suggesting Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). The patient had no antibodies against salivary protein 1 or parotid-specific proteins. Antibodies against carbonic anhydrase (CA) type VI were negative as well. A renal biopsy was conducted, which revealed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) with abundant eosinophils and significant lymphocytic and plasmatic cell infiltration (Fig. 1a and b). We concluded that our patient had primary SS with acute TIN.



The patient received aggressive therapy with potassium chloride (180 mEq/day), sodium bicarbonate (1960 mg/day), and amiloride (10 mg/day). In addition, she was treated with immunomodulatory therapy, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ; 300 mg/day), azathioprine (50–100 mg/day), and a taper of prednisone. The patient tolerated the therapy and was reevaluated as an outpatient. After 2 weeks of inpatient treatment, her potassium level remained stable (3–3.5 mEq/dl), and she was minimally symptomatic. She was discharged with close follow-up.

Her strength and weight increased over the following 5 months. However, her renal function remained decreased with a serum Cr of 1.3–1.5 mg/dl, mild hypokalemia (K+, 3.1–3.4 mEq/dl), and mild metabolic acidosis (HCO3−, 20 mEq/L), punctuated by recurrent episodes of severe hypokalemia and acidosis when she was unable to maintain the high-dose potassium and bicarbonate supplementation. Figure 3shows the trajectories of serum potassium levels and renal function as well as the influence of medical therapy during the clinical course of the patient. Her clinical course was affected by her intermittent compliance with prednisone owing to its side effects, most importantly edema and lipodystrophy. She developed chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the setting of TIN.

Sjögrens Syndrome

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with hallmark symptoms of Sjögrens syndrome, including dry eyes and mouth, in combination with positive antibodies against Sjögren’s syndrome antigen A and B. The renal biopsy demonstrating acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) with lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration further supports this diagnosis. Polyclonal gammopathy and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis are also consistent with SS.

Suitable Treatments:
* Increased citrus fruit and fluid intake, restricted intake of Na+, oxalate, fructose, and animal protein, normal Ca2+ intake
Pharmacotherapy NaHCO3 or KHCO3 (1–2 mmol/kg/day), KCl or K-citrate (in patients with severe hypokalemia)"
"A 25 year old female presents to her primary healthcare clinic complaining of flu-like symptoms which consist of a fever, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, nausea and fatigue.
8 months ago
She was admitted to hospital for cryptococcal meningitis for which she was successfully treated. At this time she was diagnosed as HIV infected with a CD4 count of 115 and a viral load (VL) of 25000 copies. She was started on an antiretroviral regimen which consists of lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T) and efavirenz (EFV).

2 months ago
She was responding well to therapy and her CD4 countincreased to 450 and her  viral load  was undetectable at <25 copies.

1 week ago
She came to the clinic complaining of weakness, myalgia, headache, nausea and general flu-like symptoms. She also complained of a non-tender lump on her left thigh. She was prescribed acetaminophenand told to return in one week if her symptoms did not improve.

Ultrasound: confirmed hepatomegaly with fat infiltration

Causes of metabolic acidosis
This occurs due to an increase in production of organic acids, resulting in a fall in HCO3 or other unmeasured anions and is thus associated with the accumulation of acids.

Causes include:

Lactic acidosis caused by sepsis, shock or hypoxia
Urate caused by renal failure
Ketones caused by diabetes mellitus, alcohol or starvation
Drugs (salicylates, biguanides, ethylene, NRTIs)
Final outcome
After 20 days her blood results were within normal ranges.

Her  CD4 count has however dropped down to 250 and her  viral load has increased to 10000 copies. Her declining CD4 count requires that she be carefully monitored and as soon as she reaches 200 she must go back onto ARV therapy. Which will again consist of two NRTIs and an NNRTI, but she will be given two different NRTIs. Fortunately toxicity does not extend to all the drugs in this class.","Diagnosis:

Drug-Induced Lactic Acidosis

* Probability: Unknown
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient has been on an antiretroviral therapy regimen that includes stavudine (d4T), known for its potential to induce lactic acidosis. The symptoms of fatigue, myalgia, and abdominal pain, combined with metabolic acidosis (low HCO3 and high anion gap), support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* All HIV medication was stopped
L-carnitine 50mg/kg was given per day
Blood lactate levels measured daily it reached 1 from 8 normal values are less than 2 mmol/L"
"Patient with epilepsy and developmental delay during adolescence who suffered an ischemic stroke at age 30. He was devoid of common risk factors of atherosclerosis such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Based on the results of laboratory examination, neuroimaging, and physiological function tests, his stroke was not caused by cardiogenic embolism, paradoxical embolism or vascular malformation. Hyperhomocysteinemia was the only factor associated with the large vessel occlusion.

At the age of 16, the patient presented with several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. He was diagnosed with epilepsy based on results of electroencephalography. Despite having started anti-epileptic drugs (AED), seizures occurred once every few months. He was prescribed a regimen of four AEDs such as valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate, and carbamazepine. At age 28, he often encountered trouble with interpersonal relationships owing to mild developmental delay. At age 30, he expressed abnormal behaviors such as taking large amounts of medications. The day after this incident, he was admitted to our hospital due to disturbed consciousness upon his mother noticing his aberrant behavior. He had no family history of coronary artery disease, stroke, or neuropsychiatric disease. His diet was unbalanced with a predilection for eating meat and avoiding vegetables.

On admission, his blood pressure was 105/64 mmHg, heart rate was 75 beats / min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths / min and body temperature 37.4°C. Physical examination was unremarkable. On neurological examination, his consciousness was somnolence. He had total aphasia and right hemiparesis. The results of laboratory examination were as follows: white blood cell count, 9.6 × 109/L (reference: 3.9–9.7 × 109/L); hemoglobin, 15.2 g/dL (reference: 13.4–17.1 g/dL); platelet count, 315 × 109/L (reference: 153–346 × 109/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 20 IU/L (reference: 5–37 IU/L); alanine aminotransferase, 27 IU/L (reference: 6–43 IU/L); blood urea nitrogen, 8 mg/dL (reference: 9–21 mg/dL); creatine, 0.61 mg/dL (reference: 0.6–1.0 mg/dL); Na, 140 mmol/L (reference: 135–145 mmol/L); K, 3.9 mmol/L (reference: 3.5–5 mmol/L); Cl, 109 mmol/L (reference: 96–107 mmol/L); total cholesterol, 179 mg/dL (reference: 150–219 mg/dL); high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol, 30 mg/dL (reference: 40–70 mg/dL); HbA1c, 4.9% (reference: 4.6–6.2%). Protein C and S were within normal limits. International normalized ratio (INR) was 1.28 (reference: 0.85–1.15), and d-dimer was 0.5 μg/mL (reference: 0–1). His thyroid function was within normal limits. Immunological examination for autoimmune disorders, including for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-SSA, anti-SSB, proteinase (PR) 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA antibodies, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were all negative. Plasma homocysteine level was markedly increased to 74.1 nmol/ml (reference: 3.7–13.5 nmol/ml), and methionine level was 28.1 nmol/ml (reference: 18.9–40.5 nmol/ml). Folate, vitamin B12, and pyridoxal were all below-normal ranges (folate: 1.0 ng/ml [reference: > 4 ng/ml], vitamin B12 135 pg/ml [reference: 180–914 pg/ml], pyridoxal 3.2 ng/ml [reference: 6–40 ng/ml]).

Genetic analysis was performed after written informed consent was obtained as MTHFR enzyme deficiency was suspected. Genetic analysis identified C677T polymorphism that appeared to be homozygous (Figure 1). Brain computed tomography showed a low intensity area in the region of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) (data not shown). On diffusion weighted imaging and FLAIR of brain magnetic resonance imaging, a large high intensity area was seen in the left MCA territory (Figures 2A, B). Additionally, magnetic resonance angiography showed that the MCA was disrupted in the M1 segment (Figure 2C). Holter electrocardiogram revealed no arrhythmia or atrial fibrillation. Transesophageal echocardiography showed no thrombus in the left atrium and no right-left shunt. He was diagnosed with atherothrombotic cerebral infarction. Administration of aspirin 200 mg/day that was started upon diagnosis was decreased to 100 mg/day after 3 weeks. To treat his hyperhomocysteinemia, folic acid (15 mg/day), vitamin B1 (150 mg/day), vitamin B6 (150 mg/day), and vitamin B12 (150 mg/day) were administered. On this course of treatment, serum folic acid, vitamin B1, and vitamin B6 increased, and serum homocysteine decreased to 5.8 nmol/ml. His consciousness gradually improved to being alert and his total aphasia ameliorated to motor aphasia. Three months after admission, his condition improved to a point at which he was able to carry out activities of daily living. Therefore, he was discharged from our hospital.

Atherothrombotic Cerebral Infarction

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presented with acute neurologic deficits (total aphasia and right hemiparesis), and imaging studies (MRI, MRA) confirmed an infarct in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) with evidential arterial occlusion. The genetic analysis revealed hyperhomocysteinemia due to MTHFR C677T homozygous polymorphism, a known risk factor for atherothrombosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* After discharge, he continued a regimen of AEDs such as valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate, and levetiracetam instead of carbamazepine
* During the 3 years after discharge, he was without seizure, and electroencephalography confirmed that he had no epileptic activity
* Administration of folic acid, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 was continued for hyperhomocysteinemia
* His plasma homocysteine level was maintained within normal limits (5.8–10.5 nmol/ml)
* Two years after discharge, a brain MRI showed no new infarction (Figures 2D, ​,E)
* E)
* MR angiography revealed that the occluded MCA had been recanalized, but no double lumen sign or string and pearls sign were detected (Figure 2F)
* For the infarct, he was treated with clopidogrel and had no recurrence of ischemia"
"A 51-year-old man with a medical history of end-stage renal disease and poorly controlled DM was admitted to the hospital after syncope with head trauma. His neurological and cardiac workups were negative and his physical examination was within normal limits except for a slightly tender and mildly swollen left knee, which was attributed to his fall. The patient went into septic shock and was started on norepinephrine for vasopressor support. Blood culture results were Streptococcus dysgalactiae positive, and he was started on ceftriaxone. However, the infection source remained unclear. As his left knee swelling had increased compared to baseline on admission, a diagnostic tap was performed that showed purulent fluid comprising 250,000 white blood cells, which were predominantly neutrophils. Our patient underwent surgical drainage in the operating room (OR), where 100 mL of purulent fluid was drained from his left knee; however, he remained in a state of sepsis and was continued on vasopressors. We undertook a computed tomography (CT) scan of the left knee as shown in Figures ​Figures1A,1A, ​,1B,1B, which showed infection extending into the popliteal fossa, along with compression of the popliteal artery and vein. He underwent further surgery to drain 500 mL of purulent fluid from the popliteal fossa.

(A) Suprapatellar effusion with hyperdensity representing undrained infection. There are also scattered foci of air within the joint fluid likely representing postoperative changes. (B) Large complex lobulated hyperdense interfascial collection within the posterior knee/leg measuring up to 17.5 x 6.8 x 7.3 cm.
Cultured samples taken from the knee joint positively confirmed Streptococcus, which was consistent with his blood sample results. Given the extent of the infection, and because he was in septic shock with high-grade bacteremia, we administered a synergistic dose of gentamycin, and management was guided by infectious disease consultants.

Postoperatively, his condition improved, vasopressors were weaned, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out infective endocarditis, the results of which were found to be vegetation negative. Therefore, we did not proceed to perform transesophageal echocardiography as the treatment duration was four weeks. He remained on ceftriaxone for four weeks, along with a synergetic dose of gentamycin with dialysis, and he was followed up in an outpatient clinic and showed good progress.

Septic arthritis typically presents as a single, warm, swollen, and painful joint with restricted mobility [1]. The knee has been reported to be the involved joint in >50% of patients [2], and patients present as febrile and in sepsis. However, older adults and poorly controlled patients with DM may present as afebrile and asymptomatic [3].

The usual causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and infection is usually monomicrobial [4]; however, Streptococci are also an important cause of septic arthritis, although not as common [5]. Diagnosis is established based on clinical suspicion and through performing a diagnostic tap of the joint, typically we see purulent fluid with between 50,000 and 150,000 cells/µL of predominantly neutrophils in patients with septic arthritis [6].","Diagnosis:

Septic arthritis of the left knee

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with a swollen, tender left knee, and the diagnostic tap showed purulent fluid with 250,000 white blood cells, predominantly neutrophils. The blood and joint cultures confirmed Streptococcus infection, which is consistent with septic arthritis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Postoperatively, his condition improved, vasopressors were weaned, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out infective endocarditis, the results of which were found to be vegetation negative
* Therefore, we did not proceed to perform transesophageal echocardiography as the treatment duration was four weeks

"A 35-year-old achondroplasia male patient visited the emergency room with right hemiplegia (motor grade II) and aphasia within 6 hours after onset. He had a clinical history of moderate mitral valve stenosis and near bedridden state due to severe inguinal hernia for the last 3 years (Fig. 1A, B). Initial vital signs were stable and routine laboratory findings were non-specific. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 14. Initial non-contrast computed tomography (CT) showed no definite low density, but angiography demonstrated the total occlusion of the left internal cerebral artery because of acute thrombosis (Fig. 1C, D). We decided to perform the mechanical thrombectomy immediately after careful consideration of the anatomical characteristics of only 130 cm tall patient. The CT angiogram in the emergency room was checked the diameters of the non-occluded MCA, ICA, and CCA, and we measured as 3.0mm, 4.2mm, and 8.2mm, respectively (Fig. 2A-C). Experientially, it was not different from other patients, and we planned to use devices of general size.

After groin puncture of the right femoral artery, a 65 cm 8-F Super arrow-flex sheath (Arrow international Inc., PA, USA) was placed in the left common carotid artery combined with 100cm 5-F Davis diagnostic catheter (Jungsung medical, Korea) coaxially. An angiogram obtained subsequent to a left internal carotid artery (ICA) injection confirmed the occlusion of distal ICA with thrombus (Fig. 3A). A 95 cm 8-F Flow gate 2 ™ balloon guiding catheter (BGC) (Concentric medical, CA, USA) was navigated in the cervical ICA. An AXS Catalyst ™ 6 (CAT 6), distal access catheter (Stryker neurovascular, CA, USA), and a 0.027 inch Excelsior XT-27 microcatheter (Stryker neurovascular) were advanced into the proximal aspect of the thrombus in the distal ICA and past the thrombus in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), respectively, guided by the 0.014 inch Synchro-14 microwire (Stryker neurovascular). The 6 × 25 mm Trevo XP provue retriever (Concentric medical) was deployed across the thrombus via the microcatheter. After waiting for about 3 minutes, the BGC was inflated to arrest the flow and the Trevo, microcatheter and CAT 6 were drawn slowly through the BGC while aspirating the BGC and CAT 6 with a 50 ml syringes. After removing these thrombectomy devices with solumbra technique,3)5)15) the BGC was deflated again and angiography was performed to confirm the recanalization of the ICA.

The first attempt was unsuccessful, but the second attempt led to complete recanalization with Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 3 in the same way (Fig. 3B, C). The procedure took 37 minutes from puncture to recanalization and some thrombi were obtained from the syringe aspirating the distal access catheter (CAT6) (Fig. 3D).

There were no complications related to the procedure and the next day, the patient showed improvement in neurological symptoms from NIHSS 14 to 5 and his right arm and leg strength from grade II to IV. On post-procedure day 3, the brain CT angiogram confirmed that left ICA was well maintained after reperfusion (Fig. 4A, B). Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg) was continued after the procedure. A few weeks later, he was transferred to another department due to the underlying problems, but his improved neurologic status and MR angiography were well sustained even at 3 months follow-up (Fig. 4C).

Acute Ischemic Stroke

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Very High (Emergency)
* Rationale: The patient presents with right hemiplegia and aphasia within 6 hours of symptom onset. CT angiogram and diagnostic ICA angiogram confirmed left distal ICA occlusion. The NIHSS score of 14 signifies a moderate to severe stroke.

Suitable Treatments:
* Immediate mechanical thrombectomy (already performed)
* Dual antiplatelet therapy post-procedure (Aspirin 100 mg and Clopidogrel 75 mg)
* Intravenous thrombolysis (if within time window and no contraindications)
* Continuous neurological monitoring and supportive care, including rehabilitation for residual deficits"
"28-year-old male patient with intraventricular hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia underwent extraventricular drainage and ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus. At 30 months after onset, he was admitted to the rehabilitation department of our university hospital. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed leukomalactic lesions in the hypothalamus, bilateral medial temporal lobe, and bilateral basal ganglia (Fig. ​(Fig.1A).1A). He showed intermittent high body temperature (maximum: 39.5°C, 38.5–39.2°C). However, he did not show any signs of infection upon physical examination or in his white blood cell count and inflammatory enzyme levels including erythrocyte sedimentation and C-reactive protein. Eight age-matched normal subjects (4 male, mean age, 26.6 years; range, 21–29 years) were enrolled in this study as control subjects. The patients father and all normal subjects has provided informed consent for publication of the case, and the local ethics committee approved the study protocol.

(A) T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance images show leukomalactic lesions in the hypothalamus (arrows), bilateral medial temporal lobe, and bilateral basal ganglia. (B) Regions of interest for the hypothalamus were localized by using the optic tract (anterior boundary), the mammillary body (posterior boundary), and the midline (medial boundary) at the level of the upper midbrain in the patient (C) and a representative normal subject.

When he showed hyperthermia during admission, we applied four types of management including external cooling methods (tepid massage and ice pack), hydration, and medication (propacetamol 1 g, intravenous injection).[11–13] He revealed similar pattern of hyperthermia in terms of intensity and frequency during two months admission at our hospital.
A multi-channel head coil on a 1.5 T Philips Gyroscan Intera (Philips, Best, Netherlands) with 32 gradients was used for the acquisition of DTI data. The patients DTI data was acquired at 30 months after stroke onset. We acquired 67 contiguous slices parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. DTI scanning parameters were as follows: acquisition matrix = 96 × 96; reconstructed to matrix = 192 × 192; field of view = 240 mm × 240 mm; repetition time = 10,398 ms; echo time = 72 ms; parallel imaging reduction factor = 2; echo-planar imaging factor = 59; b = 1000 s/mm2; number of excitations = 1; and slice thickness = 2.5 mm. Eddy current-induced image distortions were removed by using the affine multi-scale two-dimensional registration provided in the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of Brain Software Library. DTI-Studio software (CMRM, Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD) was used for evaluation of the hypothalamus, which was identified by locating the anterior boundary of the optic tract and the posterior boundary of the mammillary body at the level of the upper midbrain (Fig. ​(Fig.11A).[14] Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) estimates were obtained for the hypothalamus. Regions of interest for the hypothalamus were localized by using the optic tract (anterior boundary), the mammillary body (posterior boundary), and the midline (medial boundary) at the level of the upper midbrain in the patient (C) and a representative normal subject.

A summary of the DTI parameter results for the hypothalamus in the patient and the control groups is presented in Table ​Table1.1. The FA and ADC value of the patient were lower and higher, respectively, by more than two standard deviations from the control values (Table ​(Table11).

ADC = apparent diffusion coefficient, FA = fractional anisotropy.

Our results suggest that evaluation of the hypothalamus by using DTI would be helpful in patients show unexplained fever following brain injury.","Diagnosis:

Central Fever

* Probability: Medium
* Emergency: Moderate to High
* Rationale: The hypothalamus plays a significant role in thermoregulation, and damage to this area can result in dysregulated body temperature. The MRI findings of leukomalactic lesions in the hypothalamus, bilateral medial temporal lobe, and basal ganglia fit this condition. Other signs of infection are absent, and the intermittent high body temperature supports central fever.

Suitable Treatments:
* medications like bromocriptine or baclofen with or without surface or intravascular cooling devices"
"72-year-old man without past medical history or risk factors was referred to our Hospital for the sudden onset of vertigo and right hand numbness. MRI showed small acute ischemic lesions in left cerebellum and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory. Repeat MRI 10 days later showed an acute infarct at the right PCA territory (Fig. 1-a).

Laboratory findings did not support any acute infectious process. Electrocardiography and the 24-h Holter ECG showed no pathological findings.","Diagnosis:

viral Pharyngitis

* Probability: Medium
* Emergency: Low
* Rationale: * Sudden onset of vertigo and right-hand numbness
    * MRI shows acute ischemic lesions in the left cerebellum and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory
    * Repeat MRI shows an acute infarct in the right PCA territory

Suitable Treatments:
* Acute Phase: Intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy (if within the appropriate time window for intervention and no contraindications)
* - Long-term Management: Antiplatelet therapy (e.g
* , Aspirin or Clopidogrel), anticoagulants (if a cardioembolic source is identified), statins to manage cholesterol levels, antihypertensive medications, and lifestyle modifications"
"55-year-old female.

Presenting complaint: Feeling unwell for about five days, “I don’t want this cold to go to my chest.”

History of present illness: Started with stuffiness and feeling unwell about five days ago, but now her nasal discharge is coloured and because her symptoms have lingered, she feels an antibiotic is needed. She can’t take time off work and needs to get better as soon as possible.

She describes green nasal discharge, facial pain (especially in the cheek area under the eyes), fullness of the ears and fatigue, but no fever. She has developed a slight cough over the last two days. She is on acetaminophen for the facial discomfort.

History: Occasional gastresophageal reflux disease GERD, no previous sinusitis, no antibiotic use in the past month, no recent hospitalizations, no recent dental work, smokes occasionally (social events, when stressed), occasional use of alcohol.

Amy is allergic to minocycline, which causes a rash. She notes her mother is allergic to penicillin.

She is on no medications except OTC acetaminophen and acid blockers.

Exam: Afebrile, chest clear, no erythema over sinuses or real sinus tenderness, no tooth pain with pressure. Weighs more than 55 kg.   Levofloxacin 750 mg QD x 10 days (which was tolerated in the past).

Note: Current guidelines suggest a three-day course of levofloxacin in therapy of community-acquired pneumonia, and five days maximum in sinusitis.

Two weeks later:

Amy returns with the same head complaints and new gastrointestinal issues, worsening over six days:

Diarrhea several times daily, with cramping abdominal pain.
No appetite and nausea, no vomiting.
Has lost three kg since first becoming ill.
Inability to work, care for her granddaughter or visit her mother.
Exam: Abdomen tender but not peritonitic; active bowel sounds.

Diagnosis: probable C. difficile.

Order: C. diff toxin, CBC and diff, electrolytes and creatinine.

Rx: Vancomycin 125 mg po QID x 10d/Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID x 10 days.

One month later:

Amy returns reporting she was feeling better after the new drugs, but diarrhea has returned and she is too unwell to work. She’s lost another two kg.

Rx: Vancomycin 125mg PO QID x 10 days. Ask her not to take acid blockers if possible.

Three weeks later:

Again, an initial improvement in symptoms for about two weeks, then worsening. Feeling very unwell as before, plus she is now weak and dizzy. Further three kg weight loss. Daughter is now assisting her with household duties, etc.

Rx: Vancomycin 125mg PO QID + metronidazole 500mg PO TID x 14 days.

Two months later:

As she finished the vancomycin taper, Amy started to have looser stools with worsening the week after completion. Human Resources has advised she take short-term disability. Amy is worried she might pass C. diff to her family members. The overall low risk of this and home hygiene were discussed.

Down another two kg in weight.

Management: Restart Vancomycin taper protocol and refer for fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as has third recurrence.

Amy remained on oral Vancomycin 125 po BID awaiting FMT and was ultimately successfully treated.

Rationale:

The physician explains most rhinosinusitis is viral and even early bacterial infections get better with symptomatic management. They discuss Amy’s risk of antibiotic side effects and complications such as C. diff from unneeded antibiotics.

The physician reassures her the physical exam doesn’t show any red flags and improvement over the next five days is expected. They lay out a symptom management plan and agree she should call if she isn’t improving over that time.","Diagnosis:

Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: Symptoms like green nasal discharge, facial pain, fullness of the ears, and fatigue typically suggest bacterial rhinosinusitis, particularly when symptoms are persistent and worsening beyond five days.

Suitable Treatments:
* Amoxicillin-clavulanate or Doxycycline (due to possible allergic reaction to penicillin in the family history)
* Symptom Relief: Nasal saline irrigations, intranasal corticosteroids, acetaminophen for pain"
"44 year old female patient had been having recurrent sinus infections every month. She would get a sore throat with bad post nasal drip and cough followed by a runny nose that would lead to sinus pressure and fullness. She would get lots of mucous in her throat and need to clear it out often.This would happen every few weeks and she would end up going to Urgent Care or her primary Doctor and being told that she had a sinus infection and given antibiotics. While she would feel a little better at first the symptoms would simply come back after a period of time.

She was referred to an ENT doctor who examined her and decided to order a CT scan of her sinuses for her. The ENT advised her that the CT scan of her sinuses was essentially normal but that her exam showed evidence of silent acid reflux and possible allergies. She was tested for allergies and the results showed that she had mild allergies to dust, ragweed and trees. She was surprised to learn that allergies don’t always cause sneezing or itching eyes but can simply cause inflammation of the nose and sinuses. In addition the ENT advised her that her acid reflux was moderate and that she should be treated short term with a medication and to see a GI doctor if she does not get better. It was emphasized to her that diet and lifestyle changes were the best long term treatment for acid reflux. Again, she was surprised that even though she didn’t have any traditional symptoms like heartburn, she had an acid reflux problem that was causing her throat, nose and sinuses to get inflamed repeatedly. She was given an antacid medication to take for 4 weeks, advised to start doing saline rinses of her nose and sinuses everyday and to use a nasal spray to help her allergies.

She started adhering to a low acidic diet and decreased her coffee and alcohol intake in addition to the other measures advised and found that at 4 weeks her symptoms were remarkably better. Since she was improving the antacid medication was stopped. After 3 months, she was doing great and had stopped having any more sinus “infections”. Her throat felt very clear and her ability to breath through her nose was never better. She was also referred to an allergist who was able to develop a plan for her where she would not have use her allergy medications all the time.","Diagnosis:

Laryngopharyngeal Reflux

* Probability: High (Given the immediate response to treatment and lifestyle changes)
* Emergency: Moderate (Needs management but not immediately life-threatening)
* Rationale: The patients symptoms significantly improved with the use of antacid medication and lifestyle modifications, which are typical treatments for LPR.

Suitable Treatments:
* Saline nasal rinses daily
* Nasal corticosteroid spray for allergies
* Allergen avoidance measures
* Immunotherapy (allergy shots) for long-term management;  changing lifestyle"
"A 58‐year‐old man presented at the emergency room with a two‐day history of headache, sore throat, cough, and fever. He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media. He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn (Figure 1). He had bacterial meningitis 6 years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75 mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils size was 4 mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae(see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes (Figure 4). Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates (Figure 4). Unfortunately, on the fifth day of admission, his physical examination continued to show GCS of 3 out of 15, and brainstem reflexes were absent. A brain perfusion scan showed no brain perfusion, and he was declared brain dead.

Streptococcus pneumoniae Meningitis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The presentation of altered sensorium, fever, nuchal rigidity, positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs, and CSF findings (high WBC, high protein, low glucose, and CSF culture indicating S. pneumoniae) are classic for bacterial meningitis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),"
" A 44-year-old man with diabetes and a history of severe acute pancreatitis with encapsulated pancreatic necrosis in the context of hyperlipemia requiring admission to the intensive care unit. He was admitted for a second episode of acute pancreatitis. He initially presented renal failure and metabolic acidosis requiring admission to the intensive care unit with the need for vasopressors and the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Despite antibiotic treatment, on day 7 of admission a high fever occurred, requiring antibiotic escalation with no microbiological findings. Coinciding with the onset of fever, abdominal pain in the left flank and muscle weakness was noted.
Current symptoms include hemodynamic stability, abdominal pain in the left flank on palpation controlled with analgesics, and an absence of fever. The patient remains on oral nutrition. Laboratory tests show leukocytosis of 18,000 with neutrophilia, thrombocytosis of >1,000,000, mild anemia, and CRP 59.
An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure A) without intravenous contrast performed on admission, only showed retrogastric encapsulated necrosis in relation to previous acute necrotizing pancreatitis and intraglandular and periglandular inflammatory changes that could be compatible with flare-up.
Magnetic resonance imaging (Figure B) and an abdominal CT scan with contrast (Figure C) was requested 1 month later to control the pancreatic collection, which revealed an extensive hydro-aerial collection that replaced the splenic parenchyma, showing a thick fistulous gastrosplenic tract toward the greater gastric curvature with abundant extravasation of oral contrast to the splenic collection, and an inflammatory plastron encompassing the tail of the pancreas.
Following these findings, enteral nutrition was suspended, and parenteral nutrition was started. In addition, the patient was referred to esophagogastric surgery.

Figures A,B and C An abdominal CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast shows the presence of an intrasplenic cavity with air inside and the existence of an abnormal communication between the stomach and spleen; digestive endoscopy confirms the presence of the fistula and allows biopsies to be taken to confirm the diagnosis of malignancy in case of suspicion.","Diagnosis:

Pancreatico-Splenic Fistula

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: CT and MRI imaging show an abnormal communication between the stomach and spleen, digestive endoscopy, and the presence of an intrasplenic cavity with air. The fistulous tract and symptoms align with the progression of pancreatic disease considering the history of pancreatitis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Surgical resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy"
"A 31-year-old male patient with no prior medical history presented to the emergency room with high-grade fever for 2 days. He also had chills, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, and diarrhea. He used over-the-counter acetaminophen to control his symptoms.

On admission, the patient was oriented. His temperature was 38°C, blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg, pulse was 92 bpm, respirations were 20 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 98%. Physical examination showed no abdominal pain, no organomegaly, a negative Murphy’s sign, and no evidence of mucocutaneous bleeding. Laboratory tests were significant for thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 67.000/mm3, high hematocrit (45%), hemoglobin level of 15.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 3.310/mm3, and a positive NS1 antigen test. His liver enzymes were mildly elevated, AST was 89 U/L, and ALT was 69 U/L; serum HbsAg and HCV antibody were negative. Serum creatinine and C-reactive protein were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver and pancreas sizes, thickening gallbladder wall (8 mm), and no intraperitoneal fluid was noted. Chest X-ray was unremarkable.

In the hospital, his diarrhea was worsening, more than 5 times a day. On the fifth day after the onset of fever, he started to have burning-like abdominal pain, which was localized in the epigastrium and radiated to the back. He had 2-3 episodes of nausea and vomiting per day. He also developed petechiae over his lower limbs. Laboratory results showed elevated serum amylase (174 U/L) and lipase (606 U/L). Platelet count decreased to 10.000/U, hematocrit was 51%, leukocyte count was 5.200/mm3, and serum triglyceride was 3.81 mmol/L (Table 1). Plain abdominal computed tomography revealed an enlarged pancreas, peripancreatic fat stranding, and peripancreatic fluid collection (Balthazar score D) along with a minimal right pleural effusion (Figure 1). He was managed with intravenous fluids, analgesics, antacid, and bowel rest. Two days later, his clinical condition became stable, he started to be afebrile, the abdominal pain was resolved, and his platelet cell count was trending up. Subsequently, he was discharged without complications.

Noncontrast abdominal CT findings were consistent with acute pancreatitis, Balthazar grade D.
The two most common etiologies associated with acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol consumption. Cholelithiasis is seen in approximately 40–70% of cases, while alcoholism is present in 25–35% of cases. Less frequent causes include trauma, medications, autoimmune diseases, congenital abnormalities, hypercalcemia, or infections [4, 5]. There are many organisms associated with infectious pancreatitis, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. A notable pathogen in the tropical areas is Ascaris lumbricoides, which induces pancreatitis by obstruction of the biliary and pancreatic duct. In particular, viruses are the most common microbes that account for infectious pancreatitis, including hepatitis viruses, Coxsackie virus, mumps, varicella-zoster virus, CMV, EBV, HSV, and HIV","Diagnosis:

Dengue Fever

* Probability: High Probability
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale:

Suitable Treatments:
* pain medicine
* Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is often used to control pain
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding"
"A 23-year-old man, suspected of having arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, underwent right heart catheterization for electrophysiology testing, via left femoral vein approach, and placement of an ICD, through the left subclavian vein. Five days later, he presented to the emergency department (ED) of our institution because of left pleuritic chest pain. On examination, he showed mild tachypnea, normal body temperature, and slightly diminished breath sounds over the left lung base. Oxygen saturation was 98% on ambient air. Electrocardiogram confirmed the presence of a known incomplete right bundle brunch block with T-wave inversions in leads V1–V3, in the absence of other remarkable findings, except for heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Chest radiograph revealed mild left pleural effusion. The patient was discharged with diagnosis of pleurisy and a seven-day amoxicillin clavulanate treatment was prescribed.

Twelve days later, the patient newly presented to the hospital and was admitted to our medical ward, because of a 3-day history of right pleuritic chest pain, cough, and high-grade fever. His physical examination showed body temperature of 38.4°C, arterial blood pressure of 105/70 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, right basal hypophonesis on chest auscultation, no heart murmurs, no leg swelling, no enlarged lymph nodes, and no local signs of ICD pocket infection. A new chest radiograph documented bilateral mild pleural effusion and consolidation at the right lung base. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no cardiac dysfunction and excluded recognizable endocardial or ICD leads vegetation. Laboratory tests revealed a normal white blood cells count, with lymphocytosis and presence of atypical lymphocytes. C-reactive protein level was high (16.4 mg/dL), and procalcitonin was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnosis of pneumonia and consensual pleural effusion was proposed and after drawing blood cultures, the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

Absence of clinical improvement and persistent atypical lymphocytosis triggered a point-of-care thoracoabdominal ultrasound examination, which was conducted at the bedside by one of the internal medicine physicians caring for the patient, using a MyLab 40 US portable system (Esaote) equipped with a 3.5 MHz convex transducer. Abdominal examination detected splenomegaly (craniocaudal length of 14 cm). Chest sonography showed mild bilateral pleural effusion and pleurally based, hypoechoic, wedge, and rounded shaped lung consolidations (2 in the lower left lobe and 1 in the lower right lobe, maximum size 50 mm) presenting scant or absent bronchoaerogram (Figure 1). Thoracic findings were suggestive of PE and infarction; nevertheless, the association of multiple lung consolidations, fever and other sepsis signs, and history of ICD placement oriented diagnostic suspicion toward a SPE complicating ICD leads infection. With the aim of a more sensitive assessment of endocardial and ICD leads involvement, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was ordered, which was refused by the patient. Empiric vancomycin treatment was added to cover methicillin-resistant staphylococci. A chest contrast enhanced CT scan documented filling defects within pulmonary arteries for posterior basal segments of both lungs and confirmed the presence of basal subpleural consolidations compatible with infarct lesions. No reliable images of lung abscess were detected. Furthermore, an abdominal CT scan revealed thrombosis of the left iliofemoral vein, site of recent percutaneous puncture for cardiac catheterization. A definitive diagnosis of PE complicating iliofemoral vein thrombosis was formulated, and the patient was started on rivaroxaban. Considering the association of atypical lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, and prolonged fever, a concomitant viral illness was suspected; serologic testing confirmed an EBV primary infection (Table 2). All blood cultures drawn during hospital stay (6 sets) were negative, and procalcitonin remained persistently normal. In the absence of reliable imaging and laboratory findings of bacterial infection, antibiotics were withheld on day 7 after admission. Pleuritic chest pain and fever disappeared on day 9, and the patient was discharged home. Ambulatory controls in the following weeks showed excellent clinical conditions and progressive normalization of laboratory tests. Rivaroxaban was stopped after 3 months and the patient had an uneventful course.","Diagnosis:

Pulmonary Embolism

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of pleuritic chest pain, bilateral pleural effusion, and lung consolidations led to the suspicion of PE. The presence of filling defects within pulmonary arteries found in the chest contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed this. Additionally, lung consolidations, fever, splenomegaly, and history of ICD placement pointed towards SPE due to an infection of ICD leads.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),"
"A 70 years-old Indonesian man presented at the emergency room (ER) with epigastric discomfort that was felt since one month prior and worsened in the last five days followed by nausea and vomiting. Twelve hours prior to his admission to the ER, the epigastric pain became very intense. The patient described the pain as sharp, constant and non-radiating pain. Four hours later, the pain became dull and spread to the whole abdomen, followed with additional symptoms of fever, lethargy, abdominal fullness, constipation and inability to pass wind. The patient did not have any chest pain, palpitation or shortness of breath and no modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease was found. The patient had a history of surgery due to gastric perforation 2 years ago and was later diagnosed with gastric ulcer due to habitual self-medication with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and frequent consumption of spicy food even after the surgery.

Investigations
On physical examination, the patient was alert with a pulse rate of 68 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26 times per minute, blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg and temperature of 37.8°C. Cardiac and lung evaluation was within normal limit. The abdomen was distended with positive abdominal guarding in all quadrant, reduced bowel sounds and absent liver dullness. Surprisingly, ECG evaluation showed ST elevation in precordial lead mimicking an anteroseptal STEMI (figure 1).

Further examination was conducted to confirm the ECG findings. Chest X-ray showed no abnormal findings with cardiothoracic ratio of 47% (figure 2). Cardiac biomarker was within the normal limit (creatine kinase-myocardial band titre was 11 ng/mL). Due to laboratory limitation, troponin level could not be evaluated. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 62%, normal heart chamber and valves without any regional wall motion abnormalities, and no sign of pericardial effusion. Abdominal X-ray showed positive Rigler sign (figure 3A) and free air in peritoneal space (figure 3B). Haematological evaluation showed leucocytosis (15.4 x 10∧9/L) while serum electrolytes, renal function test and liver function test were within normal limit.

Differential diagnosis
STEMI should always be a differential diagnosis in patient presenting with ST-segment elevation. In a case with abdominal signs and symptoms involvement, perforation in the gastrointestinal tract should also be included as differential diagnosis.

Treatment
The patient was consulted to the surgeon and underwent emergency laparotomy exploration. Gastric perforation was confirmed as the underlying cause in this patient.

Outcome and follow-up
After the surgery, the ECG dynamically reverted to normal (figure 4). The patient was then discharged after 4 days without any remaining symptoms.

"A 37-year-old male patient with a background of hypertension was admitted to our emergency department with sudden dizziness and left limb weakness. Non-jet vomiting occurred before transfer to our hospital for further management, and the vomitus was gastric content. He reported no trauma, fever, or coma, he was a non-smoker, and he had no history of drug use or cardiac events. The patient was immediately subjected to a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, which revealed hemorrhage in the occipital and parietal lobes. The diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was made. He developed sudden onset chest tightness, shortness of breath, and occasional chest pain behind the sternum around 48 h after emergency hematoma evacuation. The pain was stuffy in nature and did not radiate to other places. His symptoms continued to worsen gradually, until breath sounds were observed when the patient was sitting up. There were no severe symptoms of dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis or sputum (a characteristic pink frothy sputum is often produced).

History of present illness
The patient’s medical history was only hypertension; he had not been treated regularly, and the blood pressure control was unknown. There was no other history of illness or medication.

Physical examination
The patient had warm extremities with hemodynamically stable blood pressure maintained at 128/73 mmHg and a heart rate of 77 beats per minute (bpm) on initial assessment. He was breathing smoothly on room air with clear lungs. His cardiac examination was normal and did not show any murmurs or gallops.

The physical examination was unremarkable, except for the low left limb muscle tension and the third limb muscle strength. The physical examination was carried out when the patient suffered from chest tightness. On further examination, his heart rate was faster than 100 bpm and his blood pressure had risen to 150/90 mmHg; other general conditions were stable. However, when the patient was breathing in a sitting position, auscultation revealed abnormal breath sounds, which manifested as obvious bilateral bubbling rales in the lower part of the lungs.

Laboratory examinations
The serum level of creatine kinase (CK) was 837 U/L (reference range, 38-174 U/L), that of CK isoenzyme was 26 U/L (reference range, 2-25 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 269 U/L (reference range, 109-245 U/L) and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) was 249 U/L (reference range, 72-182 U/L) at admission; other blood values were within the normal range. When the symptoms of chest tightness worsened, the patient’s blood was immediately checked for any sign of heart failure (HF). The laboratory examination showed the concentration of N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 493 pg/mL (reference range, < 85 pg/mL). Myocardial enzyme levels, including cTnI, did not exhibit normal values after serial determination: the cTnI level was increased to 0.175 ng/mL in the resting state (reference range, < 0.06 ng/mL), the CK level was 660 U/L, the CK-MB level was 26 U/L, LDH was 298 U/L, and HBDH was 271 U/L. Repeated measurements 5 d later showed the values had decreased: CPK, 49 U/L; CK-MB, 12 U/L; LDH, 231 U/L; and HBDH, 187 U/L (Figure ​(Figure11).

Imaging examinations
On admission, the emergency cerebral CT image revealed cerebral hemorrhage in the occipital and parietal lobes (Figure ​(Figure2),2), while the initial 12-lead ECG (Figure ​(Figure3A)3A) revealed a normal sinus rhythm and a regular rate within the normal range; however, T wave inversions and ST segment in leads V5 and V6 were already observed.

We made another ECG at the onset of chest tightness. It is notable that the ECG demonstrated extensive depression of the ST segment and T wave inversion, suggestive of myocardial injury. At this time, there was a prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc, 487 ms) (Figure ​(Figure3B).3B). But at this time, the chest radiograph showed no bilateral patchy opacities that are typical of pulmonary edema and consistent with the breath sounds when the patient was in a sitting position (Figure ​(Figure4).

Chest radiography at 1 d after left heart failure.
In sum, the working hypothesis of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) could be established. Further cardiological investigations, including coronary arteries with CT angiogram (CTA) of the coronary arteries, were needed to make a definite diagnosis. Considering the patient was in acute stage of ICH, coronary angiography was not timely completed.

A coronary CTA and echocardiogram (ECHO) were made at 72 h after the initial symptoms when the patient’s chest discomfort disappeared. The ECHO revealed normal sized chambers with an ejection fraction of 60% and showed no significant valvular abnormality or any wall motion abnormality (Figure ​(Figure5).5). Coronary arteries did not reveal any sign of obstruction or significant narrowing (Figure ​(Figure6).6). Another 12-lead ECG was made 11 d after the patient’s symptoms improved, by this time, the patient had returned to the same state as at admission with the recovery of ICH, but the QTc interval was now prolonged (QTc, 424 ms).

Based on all observations described in the previous sections, we diagnosed the patient with CCS.","Diagnosis:

Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate. While CAA itself is not an emergency, the intracerebral hemorrhage requires prompt management to prevent further neurological deterioration.
* Rationale: The patients age (37 years old) and the location of the intracerebral hemorrhage (occipital and parietal lobes) are suggestive of CAA. CAA is a common cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in older adults.

Suitable Treatments:
* In view of the acute hemorrhage, anticoagulation treatment was not given because the hemorrhagic risk would outweigh the antithrombotic benefits
* We reduced the symptoms (and the patient’s discomfort) using a basic symptomatic treatment with vasodilators"
"55-year-old, 89.3-kg, Caucasian male, who was transferred from an outside hospital, presented with bradycardia (heart rate was between 20 and 30 beats per minute upon admission) in August 2016. He was admitted to the outside hospital a day prior to being transferred with a 3-week history of progressively worsening generalized malaise, flu-like symptoms, and dyspnea on exertion. He also reported experiencing dyspnea on exertion and near syncope for the past week and a half. He denied experiencing any chest pain, heart palpitations, or cold intolerance. His medical history included myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, status post stent placement in 2011, hypertension, Crohn’s disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. His home medications included aspirin 81 mg once daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily, folic acid 1 mg daily, isosorbide mononitrate extended-release 60 mg once daily, lisinopril 2.5 mg once daily, mercaptopurine 100 mg twice daily, mesalamine 800 mg twice daily, ranolazine extended-release 1000 mg twice daily, and simvastatin 40 mg once daily. He had no known drug allergies. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Notably, he worked as a taxidermist at a farm. Upon initial examination, he noted having several tick bites a few weeks ago while working at his job, after which he developed erythema migrans on his right arm and abdomen. He denied any recent travel history.
Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 40 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6 degree Fahrenheit. The review of systems was remarkable for an erythematous macular rash with central clearing on the anterior aspect of right arm. Laboratory tests, including troponin I (reference <0.04 ng/mL), were unremarkable. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a second-degree AV block, fluctuating between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II heart block, with a P-R interval of 300 ms. The patient was transferred to cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) for closer monitoring. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western immunoblot tests were performed and sent to the laboratory for analysis. A presumptive diagnosis of Lyme carditis was established based on the confirmed history of tick exposure, presence of erythema migrans, and AV block. The patient was started on ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. In addition, heparin 5000 units/mL subcutaneous injection every 12 hours was initiated for venous thromboembolism prevention. All of the patient’s home medications, except carvedilol and lisinopril, were restarted. Carvedilol, a nonselective β-blocker and α1 blocker, was held to prevent the patient’s heart rate from dropping further and worsening his bradycardia. Cardiac Electrophysiology Service was consulted and agreed with the primary team’s plan for conservative management and did not see a need for a pacemaker placement.

On day 3 of hospitalization, patient’s heart rate was found to be between 50 and 60 beats per minute. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed based on the presence of Borrelia antibodies demonstrated by ELISA and Western immunoblot findings (positive for IgG and IgM anti-Borrelia antibodies). A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 60% to 65%, normal right ventricular systolic function, and no significant valve disease. A repeat ECG revealed a first-degree AV block with a P-R interval of 300 ms. When compared with the initial ECG, the patient was no longer in second-degree AV block. As the patient’s second-degree heart block had resolved, he was transferred from the CVICU to the general medicine floor, where he continued to receive ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours.

On day 5 of hospitalization, there was a marked improvement in the patient’s clinical status; though, he continued to experience weakness and fatigue. After the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter line, the patient was discharged to his home on a 28-day course of ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. On the day of discharge, the patient’s vitals were as follows: heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98 degree Fahrenheit. The patient did not develop any neurologic symptoms of Lyme disease over the course of his hospital stay. Upon discharge, all of patient’s home medications, including carvedilol and lisinopril, were restarted. In addition, the patient was instructed to follow-up with his primary care physician and cardiologist on an outpatient basis.","Diagnosis:

Lyme Carditis

* Probability: Very High (Confirmed)
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presented with documented erythema migrans, history of tick bites, and symptoms consistent with heart block. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of Borrelia antibodies (positive ELISA and Western blot for IgG and IgM anti-Borrelia antibodies). Early treatment is crucial to prevent complications.

Suitable Treatments:
* Recommended classes of antibiotics include those that have demonstrated the greatest effectiveness against Borrelia spirochete, with β-lactams, particularly cephalosporins, and tetracyclines as preferred agents.3 Treatment guidelines established by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that patients with Lyme carditis be treated with either oral or parenteral antibiotic therapy for a duration of 14 days.9 The preferred parenteral agent for Lyme carditis is ceftriaxone, and the preferred oral agents include amoxicillin, doxycycline, and cefuroxime axetil.9 Even though no evidence exists to suggest that parenteral antibiotic therapy is more efficacious than oral antibiotic therapy, a parenteral antibiotic is recommended for initial treatment of hospitalized patients.9 The parenteral antibiotic should be continued until the high-degree AV block has resolved and the P-R internal has deceased to <300 ms, after which the patient should be transitioned to an oral antibiotic for completion of therapy"
"A 30-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) due to a syncopal episode with no prodrome, shortness of breath and weakness. He reported no medical conditions and no use of recreational drugs. Three weeks prior to the presentation, he had experienced an “insect bite” on his calf after being outside. A week later, he developed chills, sweats, myalgia, back pain, headache and fatigue. Blood pressure at the ED was within normal limits; and a pulse rate of 38 bpm was detected. No

Clinical course
The ECG on presentation depicted high degree AV block that rapidly evolved into 3rd degree AV block with a junctional escape rhythm at 38 bpm (Day 1, first and second panels). Due to hemodynamic instability, a temporary transvenous pacemaker was placed through the jugular vein (Day 1, third panel). The patient was admitted to the cardiac unit for monitoring and further management. Causes of conduction disturbance in the young were ruled out (normal biological markers). Because of the recent","Diagnosis:



* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The history of an insect bite, followed by chills, sweats, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms, strongly suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infection. This is corroborated by the cardiac findings of high-degree AV block, which is a known complication of Lyme disease.

Suitable Treatments:
* Recommended classes of antibiotics include those that have demonstrated the greatest effectiveness against Borrelia spirochete, with β-lactams, particularly cephalosporins, and tetracyclines as preferred agents.3 Treatment guidelines established by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that patients with Lyme carditis be treated with either oral or parenteral antibiotic therapy for a duration of 14 days.9 The preferred parenteral agent for Lyme carditis is ceftriaxone, and the preferred oral agents include amoxicillin, doxycycline, and cefuroxime axetil.9 Even though no evidence exists to suggest that parenteral antibiotic therapy is more efficacious than oral antibiotic therapy, a parenteral antibiotic is recommended for initial treatment of hospitalized patients.9 The parenteral antibiotic should be continued until the high-degree AV block has resolved and the P-R internal has deceased to <300 ms, after which the patient should be transitioned to an oral antibiotic for completion of therapy"
"A 24-year-old woman presented with a painful lump between the breasts, accompanied by scars and channels that leak pus and blood within 1 year. The lesions first appeared 2 years ago as erythematous macules and papules on both breasts and the intermammary area without pain or itch. Some of the erythematous papules then became painful nodules. The nodules eventually became abscess-like lesions, ruptured, and leaked pus 1 year later. The patient went to a district hospital and was given oral antibiotics. The pus disappeared, and the lesion became less painful. Hypertrophic scars between the breasts with sinuses and purulent discharge were formed 1 year later. Some of the painful nodules between the breasts also reappeared. History of frequent smoking since teenage years, being overweight, and frequent sweating between the breasts were admitted. The patient denied any family history of the same complaints.

Clinical examination of the lesions revealed painful erythematous nodules, hypertrophic scars, and multiple sinuses with purulent discharge, erosions, hyperpigmented macules, and papules on both breasts as well as between the breasts (Figure 1). The sondage test on the intermammary area was positive (Figure 2), indicating a positive sinus tract formation. Histopathological examination from skin biopsy on the intermammary area revealed follicular occlusion, follicular hyperkeratosis, destroyed hair follicles, as well as apocrine glands and hair follicles surrounded by massive inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes (Figure 3). This histopathological finding supported the diagnosis of HS. Once-daily 600 mg rifampicin and twice-daily 300 mg clindamycin were given to the patient for 10 weeks. The skin lesion improved on the third week of observation.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The patients symptoms, including the painful lumps, abscess-like lesions, sinuses, purulent discharge, and hypertrophic scars, as well as histopathological findings showing follicular occlusion, hyperkeratosis, destroyed hair follicles, and massive inflammatory cells, are classic for Hidradenitis Suppurativa. HS commonly occurs in intertriginous areas and has a strong association with smoking, obesity, and hyperhidrosis—all of which the patient has.

Suitable Treatments:
* Antibiotics
* An antibiotic applied to the skin in liquid or gel form may be used to manage mild symptoms
* These types of medicines are called topical antibiotics
* For more widespread disease, your health care provider might prescribe antibiotic pills, such as doxycycline, or Monodox; clindamycin, or Cleocin; rifampin, or Rimactane; or more than one of these medicines
* Rifampin also is known as rifampicin
* People with severe disease might need to take antibiotics for months
* Steroid injections
* Triamcinolone acetonide, or Kenalog-10, injected into the sores might reduce swelling and inflammation
* Hormonal therapy
* Hormone pills, such as estrogen-containing combined oral contraceptives such as estradiol and estradiol/norgestimate might be effective for people with mild hidradenitis suppurativa
* Spironolactone often is used to reduce the need for antibiotics, and isotretinoin, which is a medicine that is used mostly to treat acne
* Isotretinoin is sometimes used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa
* Biologics
* These medicines, usually administered by injection, alter the immune system in a way that disrupts the disease cycle and improves symptoms and signs of disease within weeks
* Several of these medicines are approved to treat moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa
* Two are the tumor necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab, or Humira, and infliximab, or Remicade
* These medicines work by dampening part of the immune system called tumor necrosis factor
* Many other biologics are in clinical trials for hidradenitis suppurativa
* Retinoids
* Oral retinoids might be an option for some people with acne-like disease
* These medicines are not recommended when youre pregnant, breastfeeding or if you intend to become pregnant
* Pain medicine
* If pain relievers available without a prescription dont help, your health care provider might prescribe a stronger pain medicine or refer you to a pain clinic
* Surgery or other procedures
Combined medical and surgical approaches help manage hidradenitis suppurativa
* Surgery is an important part of disease management when a tunnel, and bump, or abscess, are present
* Which surgical approach is right for you depends on the extent and severity of your condition
* Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the options, including:

Uncovering the tunnels
* This procedure involves removing tissue to expose the tunnels under the skin
* This also is known as unroofing
* Its used for people with moderate or severe hidradenitis suppurativa
* This solution usually doesnt have to be repeated
* Punch debridement
* This procedure, also called limited unroofing, involves removing a single inflamed bump
* Laser therapy
* A carbon dioxide laser can be used to make hidradenitis suppurativa sores go away
* After this treatment, the sores are unlikely to return
* Laser hair removal can help hidradenitis suppurativa in its early stages
* Surgical removal
* This approach might be an option for people with persistent or severe symptoms
* It involves removing all the affected skin
* A skin graft might be needed to close the wound
* Even after surgery, sores might still occur in other areas
* Incision and drainage
* Surgical drainage is no longer considered an effective option for treating hidradenitis suppurativa
* The method might be considered to provide short-term pain relief, but sores usually flare again afterward"
"A 60‐year‐old female was admitted to the emergency department of Nepalgunj Army Hospital on January 1, 2023, with chief complaints of swelling of right lower leg with discharging sinus associated with pain and changes in the skin color over the local area for 7 days. She also had on and off recurrent fever, which was not associated with chills and rigors for 7 days. She had a history of cut injury by a metallic object (tin) in the heel region. She was a known case of type II diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism but was not taking medication. There was no history of any burn and chemical injury on the right leg. She had undergone hysterectomy for prolapse 2 years back.

The general appearance of the patient was ill‐looking and drowsy. Her oxygen saturation level was 86%. She was managed with oxygen support, intravenous fluid normal saline (NS), inj flucloxacillin, inj ketorolac, inj pantoprazole, and inj fevastin. The patient had then undergone serial debridement on the right lower leg. First debridement was done on January 1, 2023, and second debridement was done on January 5, 2023 (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). In the bacteriological culture of the discharging sinus from the right lower leg, no bacterial growth was seen after 48 h of incubation at 37°C.

She was then referred to the surgery department. Also, her blood sample and pus collected from the draining sinus were sent for microbiological culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. She underwent her redebridement on January 10, 2023 and January 12, 2023 under subarachnoid block. In the last surgical intervention, necrotic tissue was no longer detectable. During bacteriological culture of pus collected from her wound, growth of Acinetobacter spp. was detected, which was resistant to piperacillin. But the blood culture was negative for growth of any bacteria. The diagnosis of necrotizing fascia was confirmed intraoperatively by necrosis of fascia and by the analysis of tissue samples, which revealed Acinetobacter infection.","Diagnosis:

Necrotizing Fasciitis

* Probability: High (Confirmed intraoperatively and microbiologically)
* Emergency: High (Requires immediate and aggressive treatment)
* Rationale: The patient presented with severe local infection symptoms (swelling, discharging sinus, pain, skin color changes), systemic symptoms (fever), and a history of trauma (cut injury by metallic object). The clinical findings of necrotic tissue during debridement and positive culture for Acinetobacter spp. confirm NF.

Suitable Treatments:
* She was kept under intravenous antibiotics and regular monitoring of complete blood count and renal function test
* Initially to treat the infection, she was kept on fluconazole but after the culture and antimicrobial sensitivity test report showing Acinetobacter infection that was resistant to piperacillin, she was given imipenem–cilastatin combination
* She was advised for leg elevation to 15°
* She was managed with daily in‐situ dressing with no soakage till February 24, 2023
* Later, the patient underwent split‐thickness skin graft
* She was kept under evaluation for some days and then discharged on medical advice"
"A 29-year-old male farmer was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, appetite loss, and diarrhea as his main complaints for the last 2 weeks. The patient was hospitalized after presenting with heat, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, watery diarrhea, back pain, and generalized body aches over the previous 2 weeks. The patient has been farming in an area where manure has been used as fertilizer for the past 12 years. In the past, he had grown vegetables and crops in animal manure. After eating lunch at roughly 3 p.m., the patient started experiencing diarrhea at midnight. The symptoms did not improve after treatment with antidiarrheal and antipyretics for a few days. After worsening symptoms, he was transported to the hospital and was diagnosed with probable enteric fever based on his medical history, which revealed poor hygiene, fever, gastrointestinal pain, and lettuce consumption. His financial situation makes it clear that he must utilize animal manure to grow vegetables and other crops more quickly because he cannot purchase artificial fertilizers.

The patient grew lettuce this season since he loved it so much. The vegetables had recently become ripe enough to be sliced, eaten, or sold. He brought home some of the lettuce from work one day. He ate it for dinner, but after it had been left out in an open space within the house for a few days. Within 12 hours of consumption, the farmer exhibited the aforementioned clinical signs. We decided to identify the disease type through laboratory investigations and diagnostic criteria after the patient stated, ""I had reason to believe typhoid fever because the lettuce I ate was grown on animal manure and not washed with fresh water after keeping it at home for some days.""

Physical examination revealed a high-grade fever (105.4°F) (reference range: 98.6°F), a coated tongue, mild dehydration, heart palpitations, a heart rate of 112 beats per minute (reference range: 60-100 beats per minute), a breath rate of 14 breaths per minute (reference range: 12-16 breaths every minute), and a blood pressure reading of 118/78 mmHg (reference range: 120/80 mmHg). The results of the remaining tests were uneventful. Blood cultures were obtained and other laboratory investigations were performed. Table ​Table11 lists the results of the laboratory investigations.

No malaria parasites were found in the thick and thin peripheral blood smear examination. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and pelvis was done to rule out any local complication which was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed lymphopenia and a decreased white blood cell count. The patient received paracetamol for fever and metronidazole for diarrhea and prevention of pseudomembranous colitis. The patient recovered within 7 days, and none of his relatives had the same symptoms.

On admission, ciprofloxacin 500 mg was started twice daily for 7 days to treat typhoid by suppressing the growth of S. Typhi DNA topoisomerase and DNA gyrase. Paracetamol 500 mg was administered three times daily for 7 days starting on the same day to reduce the temperature by preventing prostaglandin E2 secretion, which increases heat secretion and decreases heat loss. Most of the patients symptoms disappeared after 6 to 7 days, except for a low-grade fever that was still present. Seven days after the order for blood culture, a blood culture report was also obtained. The culture report showed S. Typhi isolation after 7 days, which was sensitive to azithromycin, amikacin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. The culture report also reported resistance to cefoperazone/sulbactam, co-trimoxazole, cefixime, cefotaxime, and amoxicillin. The patient was hospitalized, treated for typhoid fever, and sent home with the necessary medication. On follow-up after 2 weeks, the patient was doing fine.","Diagnosis:

Typhoid Fever

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The onset of symptoms linked to ingestion of food grown in unhygienic conditions, classic symptoms including high-grade fever, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal complaints match the clinical presentation of typhoid fever. Blood culture confirmed the isolation of S. Typhi.

Suitable Treatments:
* Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics
* Antimicrobial resistance is common with likelihood of more complicated and expensive treatment options required in the most affected regions
* Even when the symptoms go away, people may still be carrying typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others, through shedding of bacteria in their faeces
* It is important for people being treated for typhoid fever to do the following:

Take prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has prescribed
* Wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and avoid preparing or serving food for other people
* This will lower the chance of passing the infection on to someone else
* Have their doctor test to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in their body"
"A 29-year-old woman was evaluated at a primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
The patient had been in her usual state of good health until the day before presentation, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and a mild nonproductive cough developed suddenly. She had no sinus congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Over the telephone on the morning before presentation, she reported that her symptoms were severe and had prevented her from attending work. However, when she was evaluated later in the day by a provider at her primary care clinic, she reported that she had had spontaneous improvement in the morning and felt well on arrival at the clinic.
The patient had a history of exercise-induced asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vitiligo, and genital warts. Two years before presentation, she had had negative screening tests for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Fifteen months before presentation, she had received a diagnosis of influenza. During the months that followed, she had reported persistent bouts of fatigue and excessive sleepiness that had resulted in two motor vehicle accidents.
During the first event, which had occurred 13 months before presentation, the patient fell asleep while driving and her car crossed into the other lane, over the curb, and into an open space beside the road. She did not collide with any other vehicles or structures and had no trauma. During the second event, which had occurred 7 months before presentation, the patient collided with a turning vehicle. She did not lose consciousness, and the airbags did not deploy. After the crash, she had intermittent painful episodes of muscle spasms in her neck and low back that limited her range of motion. She was too fatigued to seek medical attention until the day after the collision.
The patient subsequently underwent evaluation at her primary care clinic. Her score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 20, with scores ranging from 0 (low-normal daytime sleepiness) to 24 (excessive daytime sleepiness). She was referred for a formal sleep study. In addition, she received prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine and completed outpatient physical therapy, and her muscle spasms diminished.
The patient had not undergone any surgical procedures. Medications included omeprazole, varenicline, naproxen, and cyclobenzaprine. Hydrocodone–acetaminophen had caused nausea. The patient was adopted, and her family history was unknown. She lived in an urban neighborhood in New England with her daughter, brother, and sister. She worked two full-time jobs, as a school counselor and a bartender. She smoked one pack of cigarettes weekly and had done so for 17 years, and she reportedly drank two to three alcoholic beverages weekly.
On physical examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 117/91 mmHg. The weight was 63.5 kg, the height 170 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. The patient appeared to be well. She had no diaphoresis or rashes, needle marks, or scars. The pupils were equal and reactive, the mucous membranes were moist, and the abdomen was soft, with no tenderness on palpation. Results of liver-function tests were normal, and testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.
Just before the conclusion of the office visit, the patient reported a history of use of nonprescribed oxycodone–acetaminophen tablets and requested initiation of therapy with injectable intramuscular naltrexone. Urine toxicology screening was ordered, and oral naltrexone was prescribed. A follow-up visit was planned for 6 days later, but the patient did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to the clinic for her scheduled follow-up. However, 2 months later, she requested a referral for psychotherapy because of increased symptoms of stress.
Four months after she requested the referral and 6 months after presentation, the patient was seen in the outpatient psychology clinic of this hospital, where additional history was obtained. She reported poor sleep, low energy, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, feelings of guilt, increased appetite, and a sensation that her legs were heavy and difficult to move. She also reported intermittent episodes of heightened energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and excessive spending. She had no history of hallucinations or thoughts of harming herself or others.
At the psychology clinic, the patient reported that she had begun to use illicit drugs — including marijuana, oral opioids, cocaine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine — when she was in middle school. She had continued to use multiple substances for 5 years but had abruptly discontinued when she became pregnant, at 19 years of age. She did not use illicit drugs for 8 years after the birth of her daughter but then resumed regular use of oral opioids 3 years before presentation, when she began to work at a bar where drugs were frequently available. Since then, she had used escalating amounts of oral oxycodone to satisfy increased cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms.
The patient reported that she used 120 mgof oxycodone per day and spent approximately $3000 per month on oxycodone. She had missed work because of withdrawal symptoms, and she worried that she would lose custody of her daughter because of her drug use. She had never been hospitalized for opioid use or had an overdose. On several occasions, she had used nonprescribed buprenorphine, which had alleviated her withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but she had never tried buprenorphine treatment that had been prescribed by a health care provider. In addition, on several occasions, she had tried to initiate treatment with injectable intramuscular naltrexone but had been unable to abstain from opioid use long enough to receive the treatment. A plan was made for the patient to continue with outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises, and a follow-up visit with her primary care physician was scheduled.
One month later, the patient was seen by her primary care physician. Oral-fluid toxicology screening was positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine; testing of the saliva was negative for fentanyl. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.","Diagnosis:

Opioid Use Disorder

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate. While not immediately life-threatening, untreated OUD can lead to overdose, infections, and other complications.
* Rationale: The patient has a history of long-term opioid use, escalating doses, withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and failed attempts to quit. The oral-fluid toxicology screening was positive for oxycodone and buprenorphine.

Suitable Treatments:
* First-line treatment for this patient would be one of the three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorder: naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine
* These medications lead to longer retention in treatment and decreased opioid use and opioid cravings
* In a meta-analysis, methadone and buprenorphine were strongly associated with decreased rates of overdose and death from any cause.2 In choosing the best medication for this patient, it would be necessary to have an understanding of not only the treatment-program requirements for each medication but also the patient’s preferences and previous experience with these medications"
"A 75-year-old male presented to the ER with diffuse abdominal pain, associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a fever of 38.5ºC within one day of evolution. The past medical history of the patient was remarkable for long-standing hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. He did not have the habit of smoking or alcohol consumption. His medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and acetylsalicylic acid. Upon examination, the patient was alert and looked distressed while his pulse rate was 130 bpm, blood pressure was 67/38 mmHg, respiratory rate was 26 bpm, and temperature was 36.7℃. His abdomen was distended, and he had diffuse tenderness on palpation of the abdomen and no other remarkable findings. Bowel sounds were present and normal. His peripheral pulses were reduced and capillary refill time was increased. Initial consideration included sepsis; this patient was resuscitated with 0.9% NaCl at 30 ml/kg and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Laboratory investigation revealed a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, creatinine 2,78 mg/dL, and urea 70 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis and lactate of 8 mmol/L (Table ​(Table1).

Point-of-care ultrasound was not available. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed and revealed a large aneurysm in the infrarenal aorta with a longitudinal extension of about 17 cm, starting distally to the emergence of the renal arteries until the bifurcation of the iliac arteries and with slight extension to the proximal left iliac artery, of 8.1 x 8.0 cm, and did not exclude aneurysmal rupture or dissection. A mural thrombus about 4.6 cm thick was present (Figure ​(Figure11).

Object name is cureus-0014-00000029166-i01.jpgCT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with an aortic abdominal aneurysm and thrombus (arrow)
The patient remained hypotensive despite the large volume of fluid resuscitation, and a jugular central venous catheter (CVC) was placed in order to start treatment with norepinephrine and referred to a vascular surgery team because there was a possibility that the aneurysm was ruptured. The patient was admitted for surgical treatment. During surgery, it was possible to observe a ruptured aneurysm, aortic thrombosis, and intestinal ischemia. However, it was not possible to repair the aneurysm, and the patient progressed to refractory hemorrhagic shock and died during the surgery.

Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The patients hemodynamic instability, abdominal distension, and CT findings of a large aneurysm suggest a high likelihood of a ruptured AAA. The presence of a mural thrombus and inability to exclude rupture or dissection further supports this diagnosis. Moreover, his hypotension and shock despite fluid resuscitation are indicative of a significant internal bleeding source.

Suitable Treatments:
* Surgery to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm is generally recommended if the aneurysm is 1.9 to 2.2 inches (4.8 to 5.6 centimeters) or larger, or if its growing quickly
* Repair surgery also may be recommended if you have symptoms such as stomach pain or have a leaking, tender or painful aneurysm
* The type of surgery done depends on:

The size and location of the aneurysm
* Your age
* Your overall health
* Abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment options may include:

Endovascular repair
* This treatment is most often used to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm
* A surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, through an artery in the groin area and guides it to the aorta
* A metal mesh tube on the end of the catheter is placed at the site of the aneurysm
* The mesh tube, called a graft, expands, and strengthens the weakened area of the aorta
* This helps prevent rupture of the aneurysm
* Endovascular surgery isnt an option for everyone with an abdominal aortic aneurysm
* You and your health care team should discuss the best repair option for you
* Regular imaging tests are done after this treatment to make sure the blood vessel isnt leaking
* Open surgery
* This is major surgery
* A surgeon removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a graft, which is sewn into place
* Full recovery may take a month or more"
"31-year-old man presenting with abdominal pain and two periods of biliary vomiting and food intolerance. The patient’s pain was predominantly perceived in the right half of the abdomen and epigastrium. The patient also had a fever and chills and no history of melena, hematemesis, and any specific diseases. However, he had a history of opium and alcohol use.

Baseline vital signs included the blood pressure of 115.65, pulse rate of 120, respiratory rate of 30, and temperature of 38°C. Initially, the patient was fully conscious and oriented despite appearing restless on physical examination. He also had normal heart sounds without heart murmur, and the lungs had normal hearing as well. There was tenderness on the right abdomen and epigastrium and no organomegaly on the abdominal palpation. Neurological examinations were normal.

2.1. Laboratory Results
White blood cell count was 10,800, hemoglobin was 19.6, platelet count was 104, blood sugar was 222, sodium level was 132, potassium level was 4.4, calcium level was 16.5, liver enzymes were measured to be 58 and 38, creatinine level was 0.5, sedimentation was estimated at 97, C-reactive protein was 48, total bilirubin was 0.8, lipase was 88.99, and amylase level was estimated at 74.

2.2. Chest X-Ray
No specific pathological findings were observed in the lung scan of the patient.

2.3. Abdominal and Pelvic CT-Scan
Edema and stranding of pancreatic tissue and peripancreatic showing pancreatitis. A focus of non enhancement seen in trunk of pancreas with volume of < 30%, suggesting necrosis; evidence of acute necrosis seen in spaces of peripancreatic masses and with spread to paracolic gutters on both sides; evidence suggesting necrotizing pancreatitis) (Figure 1).

2.4. Ultrasound
Ultrasound was performed for the free fluid in the splenorenal space and Morrison’s pouch, and the pancreas was observed to be heterogeneous and larger than normal. Furthermore, there was evidence of perivascular inflammation and inflammatory changes around the pancreas, extending to the right anterior parenchyma with the less involvement of the left anterior parenchyma caused by acute pancreatitis. The liver had normal dimensions and echo, the gallbladder was without stones and slug of intrahepatic bile ducts, and common bile duct was normal as well.

As mentioned earlier, triglycerides were measured, and the level was estimated at 1,415 (normal < 150).","Diagnosis:

Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients symptoms (abdominal pain, biliary vomiting, fever, chills) along with the CT and ultrasound findings (pancreatic edema, necrosis, and peripancreatic inflammation) clearly indicate acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The laboratory tests (elevated lipase and amylase, high CRP) support the diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Due to respiratory distress and seizures, the patient was intubated in the emergency section upon admission to the ICU
* After eight days, the patient was extubated and transferred to the ward
* Notably, the patient had an early admission to the dialysis ward due to aneuria and hypercalcemia, and endocrine counseling was provided for the high triglycerides; no apheresis was required
* After stabilization, the patient underwent an endoscopic ultrasound, and after several days of antibiotic treatment, he was discharged in good overall condition and advised to refer to an outpatient clinic after one week"
"A 55 year aged farmer, normotensive, non-diabetic, non-alcoholic, and ex-smoker presented with the complaints of high-grade fever, upper abdominal pain, and vomiting for 3 days. Initially, fever was high grade continued type without chills and rigor. Fever was associated with generalized body pain more marked at retro-orbital and sacral area. However, fever was not associated with sore throat, cough, short of breathing, headache, and burning sensation of micturition. He had also no recent travelling history anywhere. He also complained sudden onset, constant, moderate–severe upper abdominal pain which radiated to the back side of his body. His upper abdominal pain was aggravated by taking food but relieved by leaning forward and sometimes by antispasmodic medications. His bladder and bowel habits were normal; there was no bleeding per oral and anus. He had no similar attack of upper abdominal pain and previous history of hospitalization for any reason. He did not take any offending medications prior to this event. Abdominal pain was associated with vomiting for several times. There were only food particles but no bleeding per se and vomiting were mostly post-meal.

On admission, his physical examination revealed pale looking, average body build, pulse-82 bpm, blood pressure-105/65 mm of Hg, temperature-102°F, SpO2-97% on room air but there were no anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, oedema, clubbing, and lymphadenopathy. His gastro-intestinal system examination revealed moderately severe diffuse tenderness at the epigastrium, upper border of liver dullness at right fifth intercostal space along the mid-clavicular line and presence of bowel sound but no organomegally. His other systems examination revealed no abnormalities. With above all of his clinical features and examination findings made us to think him about as a case of Dengue fever with acute pancreatitis in the current dengue epidemic phase of Bangladesh.

First day of his admission, the investigation findings were platelet count-83,000/cumm, hematocrit- 49.5%, random blood sugar-6.44 mmol/L, S creatinine-1.1 mg/dL, S bilirubin-0.93 mg/dL, SGPT-50 U/L, S Amylase-430 U/L, S Lipase-68 U/L, positive NS1 antigen for Dengue and negative IgM, and IgG antibody for Dengue. There were mild ascites, right sided mild pleural effusion, small right renal cortical cyst (16 × 15 mm) and mild hepatomegaly in his ultrasonography of abdomen but normal ECG and plain X-Ray abdomen in erect posture with both dome of diaphragm (Table 1). On the second day of his admission, CT scan of Abdomen had shown features suggestive of acute pancreatitis, mild hepatomegaly, mild ascites, right sided mild pleural effusion, and right renal small cortical cyst (Figure 1).

Figure 1 CT Scan of abdomen showing bulky pancreas.
Our patient was treated conservatively with intravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, proton pump inhibitor, and opioid analgesic. On the second day of his admission, his S Calcium level revealed 1.70 mmol/L which corrected by intravenous Calcium. On the same day we had done all other investigations including fasting triglyceride which was 530 mg/dL. A serial platelet count and hematocrit were done which were 80,000/cumm and 44.6% on fifth day; and 204,000 and 44.6% on ninth day of his disease process, respectively (Table 1). His clinical, hematological and biochemical parameter were gradually improved without any uneventful situations. We discharged the patient on the tenth day of his disease process without any uneventful condition. We followed up him 7 days after discharge with an ultrasonography of hepato-biliary system where we did not find any complications including pseudo cyst in pancreas.

Details are in the caption following the image","Diagnosis:

Dengue Fever with Acute Pancreatitis

* Probability: Unknown
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with high-grade fever, generalized body ache, especially in retro-orbital and sacral areas, thrombocytopenia, and positive NS1 antigen for Dengue. Additionally, the specific gastro-intestinal manifestation—high serum amylase and lipase levels, CT findings suggestive of acute pancreatitis, and abdominal pain—aligns with acute pancreatitis complicating Dengue fever, a known but rare complication.

Suitable Treatments:
* There are no specific antiviral drugs to treat dengue infection
* Acetaminophen or paracetamol can be taken to control muscle aches, pains, and fever
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided
* Hospitalised dengue patients must be closely observed and their fluid intake carefully managed, according to strict guidelines
* In countries where early detection and such medical care is available, the fatality rate from dengue has dropped to below 1%
* The currently available vaccine is limited to people aged 9-45 years old who have had at least one previous episode of dengue virus infection
* Several additional dengue vaccine candidates are under evaluation
* The lack of treatment options increases the risk of people developing severe dengue, which is potentially fatal"
"A 27-year-old female was admitted to the hospital because of left hemiplegia and aphasia. She was 162 centimeters tall and 30 kilograms in weight. She was born after a normal pregnancy and delivery. There was no family history of neurological diseases. Motor and intellectual development was normally attained during infancy. She was hospitalized for general muscle weakness and gait disturbance when she was 6 years old. A neurologic exam showed decreased muscle tone and strength, and atrophic muscle mass. She had consistent muscle weakness, so a muscle biopsy was performed from the calf muscle when she was 8 years old. The biopsy showed mitochondrial myopathy of the pleoconial type. Her first echocardiography was completed afterwards and showed marked hypertrophy of both ventricles without any regional wall problems. Follow-up procedures were performed in an outpatient clinic once or twice a year.

When she was 24 years old she had sudden syncope. An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute infarction of the left basal ganglia and the left frontal lobe. Two years later, when the patient was 26, she had another stroke and presented with general weakness, aphagia, and dysarthria. An MRI showed old multifocal infarctions at the basal ganglia, thalamus, left pons and left periventricular white matter area. An MR spectroscopy showed a positive lactate peak in both basal ganglia. These clinical and radiological findings suggested brain involvement of MELAS syndrome. Thus, further evaluation was done for MELAS syndrome including blood lactate and genetic analysis.

The plasma lactate level was 21.8 mg/dL (normal range 4.5-19.8 mg/dL). CBC, electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were in the normal range. Thyroid function was also measured. The free T4 was 1.76 ng/dL (normal range 0.89-1.76 ng/dL) and TSH was 0.04 µIU/mL. Levels of complement component 3 and 4 were 13 mg/dL (normal range 75-145 mg/dL) and 18 mg/dL (normal range 12-72 mg/dL) respectively. Antistreptolysin O antibody was negative, rheumatoid factor was negative, and anti-double stranded DNA was 1.6 (normal range 0-6). Lupus anticoagulants and anti cytoplasmic antibody, which were measured to rule out vasculitis, were normal. A DNA gene sequencing study showed a mutation: m.3303C>T mutation in the mitochondrially encoded tRNA leucine 1 gene, which confirmed the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome. She was treated with supportive care and rehabilitation for a month and was then discharged. Warfarin was used during the hospital stay, but was stopped when she was discharged, because MELAS syndrome causes nonvascular infarct and there is no report about the related risk of thromboembolism.

One year later, she presented with another stroke with associated left sided weakness, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital. Her vital signs were stable and there were no specific findings in chest X-rays or electrocardiography. Her MRI revealed infarction in the right middle cerebral territory (Fig. 1). An magnetic resonance angiography showed an occluded right distal internal carotid artery and right middle cerebral artery (Fig. 2). An echocardiography was performed to identify the cardiac origin of the ischemic stroke, and it showed concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle with globally hypokinetic wall motion and ejection fraction of 25%. An intracardiac thrombus attached to the left ventricular apex was noted (Fig. 3). The patients mental status and general condition improved after she was treated with mannitol and anticoagulation therapy. Rehabilitation and supportive care, including warfarin, were followed and maintained. The patient was discharged after a month.

Cardiac involvement in MELAS syndrome is reported to be as high as 18-100%.7),8) Cardiac abnormalities manifest as impulse generation or conduction abnormalities, or as abnormalities of the left ventricular myocardium. The most common pathology is non-obstructive concentric hypertrophy, although dilatation is also reported and might be seen as progression of the initial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","Diagnosis:

MELAS Syndrome

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale:

Suitable Treatments:
* Antiseizure medications: But you should avoid valproate
* Coenzyme Q10 or L-carnitine: These products may increase mitochondrial energy output and slow the progression of MELAS syndrome
* L-arginine and L-citrulline: These products may decrease the number and effects of stroke-like episodes
* Insulin or metformin: This is used to treat diabetes
* Appropriate vaccines: People with MELAS syndrome should receive the necessary childhood vaccines, as well as annual COVID-19, flu and pneumonia vaccines
* Nonmedical treatments for MELAS syndrome
Your provider may also suggest an exercise routine for muscle strength and/or cochlear implants to help with hearing"
"53-year-old African American female who was brought to the emergency department (ED) with chief complaints of dizziness and lightheadedness since the morning of presentation associated with generalized weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath a few days before presentation. She is a resident of a nursing home. Upon the arrival of emergency medical services at her nursing facility, her blood sugar was 34 mg/dL, and she was given dextrose. The patient was on metformin 850 mg twice a day for her diabetes mellitus. There was no recent change in medication dose or regimen, and she took the medication the previous night. She denied any chest pain, headache, blurry vision, syncope, new onset of weakness of any body part, abdominal pain, or nausea.

The patient has medical comorbidities of type II diabetes mellitus on metformin with the most recent hemoglobin A1c of 6.9%, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3a with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura on maintenance rituximab.

When she arrived in the ED, she was tachypneic and diaphoretic. Her initial vitals revealed a blood pressure of 109/52 mmHg, pulse of 121 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/minute, and saturating 98% on 2 Lnasal cannula. Her finger stick blood glucose was 91 mg/dL. She stated that her dizziness and lightheadedness have resolved. Systemic examination was significant for tachycardia, tachypnea, mild bilateral lower extremity edema, and weakness of the left side, residual from her previous stroke.

Her initial blood laboratory work was significant for severe acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 6.6 mg/dL with a baseline of 1.4 mg/dL, eGFR of 8.51 mL/minute/1.73 m2, potassium of 6.7 mmol/L, and blood gas showing severe anion gap (AGAP) metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 20 mmol/L (Table ​(Table1).1). Other significant laboratory results include serum acetaminophen level of <0.3 mg/dL (normal range: 3-10 mg/dL), hemoglobin A1c of 4.6%, insulin level of 9.7 uIU/mL (optimal: ≤19.6 uIU/mL), serum creatine kinase of 21 unit/L (normal range: 20-200 unit/L), and ethanol level of <10 mg/dL. The intensive care unit (ICU) was consulted for severe AKI, hyperkalemia, and possible sepsis, and nephrology was consulted for emergent dialysis. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and immediate central venous access was obtained for hemodialysis. She received hemodialysis in the ED and was transferred to the ICU for further management. In the ICU, her AKI and other blood parameters improved and did not require further dialysis. The patient was later transferred to the medical floor.

Blood culture on admission revealed polymicrobial bacteremia including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which raised suspicion for contaminated specimens; repeat blood cultures, urine culture, and pneumonia workup came back negative. The patient remains afebrile and never requires pressors or hemodynamic support during the clinical course, lowering the suspicion of underlying sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were later discontinued after a negative septic workup. The patients renal function eventually improved with a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL on day 8 of admission, and she was finally discharged back to the nursing home.","Diagnosis:

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High - life-threatening condition requiring immediate treatment
* Rationale: The patients severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with high lactate levels, acute kidney injury, and history of metformin use for diabetes mellitus strongly suggest MALA. The patients comorbidities, including CKD, further increase the risk of MALA.

Suitable Treatments:
* Discontinue metformin, provide supportive care, and initiate hemodialysis to correct acidosis and remove metformin from the system"
"A 50-year-old male patient with carcinoma buccal mucosa with ulcerative neck lymph nodes was posted for wide excision, and reconstruction. The patient was diabetic on diet control. Other systems were normal. He had restricted mouth opening. Preoperative blood investigations, echocardiogram, ECG were essentially normal. After attaching preinduction monitors airway was topicalized with lignocaine 2% jelly and 10% spray. Transtracheal block was given with 4 ml 4% lignocaine. He was intubated awake using a fiberoptic bronchoscope with a 7.0 mm nasal endotracheal tube. He was then induced with propofol; vecuronium was used as relaxant and morphine as analgesic. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen nitrous oxide (1 : 1) mixture under positive pressure ventilation. Mandibulectomy and resection of tumor were done, and reconstruction was done with a large anterolateral thigh flap. Surgery lasted 14 h, 4500 ml Ringer’s lactate, 4 U of packed red blood cells, 200 ml albumin, and two units of fresh frozen plasma were given. Arterial blood gases were normal in the immediate postoperative period. Gradually, the patient developed hypotension with fall in hemoglobin to 7 g/dl, which was corrected with two units of packed red blood cells. There was worsening of blood gas parameters to metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 7. As blood sugars were high (230 mg/dl) 8 U of plain bolus insulin was given and an infusion was started at 4 U/h. Urine ketones were absent. Blood sugars started to decrease, but there was persistent increase in lactate levels with worsening of acidosis and hypotension. Sodium bicarbonate bolus 50 ml over 1 h was given as the pH dropped to 7.092. Noradrenaline 0.15 mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 0.05 U/min were started. Due to persistent hypotension with fall in hemoglobin levels and flap congestion the patient was reexplored. Once anastomotic site was exposed blood was taken from the free flap vein and sent for blood gas analysis. The free flap venous blood showed lactate levels, which were much higher than that in arterial blood. Venous thrombus in the flap vein was removed and reanastomosis was done following which the flap started to perfuse normally. Postoperatively, there was gradual drop in lactate with normalization of pH (Table 1), and hemodynamic supports were tapered. Arterial blood gas analysis was normal after 8 h.

Lactic acidosis usually occurs in the presence of inadequate tissue perfusion, abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism, and with the use of certain medications. Shock and severe lactic acidosis (pH <7.2) carries a mortality rate of about 50%[2]. It has been shown that intra-flap venous blood lactate values reflect circulation of free flaps[3]. Hypoperfusion of small free flaps may not have significant systemic effects. However, multiple or large flaps could possibly have an influence as seen in our patient. It is concluded that the possibility of hypoperfusion of a large free flap contributing to lactic acidosis should be considered in cases of unexplained postoperative lactic acidosis.




Table 1 Arterial blood gas and free flap venous blood gas analysis values at various time points","Diagnosis:

Venous Thrombosis in Free Flap Anastomosis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: Venous thrombus in the flap vein was detected during re-exploration, explaining the elevated lactate levels in the venous blood from the flap, flap congestion, and systemic lactic acidosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Reexploration and correction of venous thrombus in the flap vein, followed by reanastomosis to restore normal flap perfusion"
"A 77-year-old man with a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic alcohol abuse, and prostate and bladder cancer presented to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea lasting for five days. His home medications included metformin 1,000 mgtwice a day, sitagliptin 100 mg once a day, glipizide 10 mg once a day, lisinopril 2.5 mgonce a day, and metoprolol succinate 50 mgonce a day. His last primary care physician follow-up was nine months prior to presentation, and at that time, his baseline creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL (normal range: 0.50-1.30 mg/dL). On arrival to the emergency department, he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 180/78 mmHg, heart rate 94 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and 100% saturation on room air. The patient was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. His physical examination was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings were remarkable with a white blood cell count of 11.13 K/µL (normal range: 3.80-1.50 K/µL), lipase of 1,597 U/L (normal range: 73-393 U/L), sodium level of 131 mmol/L (normal range: 135-145 mmol/L), potassium of 5.4 mmol/L (normal range: 3.5-5.3 mmol/L), and bicarbonate of 15 mmol/L (normal range: 22-31 mmol/L). His anion gap was 18 mmol/L (normal range: 5-17 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen was 55 mg/dL (normal range: 7-18 mg/dL), creatinine was 7.39 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 6 mL/min/1.73 m2. His albumin level was 3.7 g/dL (normal range: 3.5-5.0 g/dL), lactate was 9.7 mmol/L (normal range: 0.7-2.0 mmol/L), and his blood glucose level was 23 mg/dL. A CT scan of his abdomen showed no acute abdominal pathology but was significant for bilateral lower lung opacities. Blood and urine cultures were sent for evaluation. He was admitted with alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis, sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia, and acute kidney failure. Metformin toxicity was a concern in the setting of acute kidney failure secondary to gastrointestinal losses due to acute pancreatitis. His metformin levels were tested. He received aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation and was started on piperacillin-tazobactam.

Within four hours of admission, the patient developed acute respiratory distress. A chest X-ray showed severe bilateral infiltrates concerning pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The patient was started on noninvasive ventilation and was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. His respiratory status continued to worsen, requiring endotracheal intubation and pressor support for a distributive shock from sepsis and sedative medication. His repeat laboratory evaluation results were significant for lactate of 13.1 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 8 mmol/L, anion gap of 26 mmol/L, and arterial pH of 6.94 (normal range: 7.35-7.45). The patient was in severe metabolic acidosis due to metformin toxicity (i.e., MALA) in the setting of acute kidney failure due to acute pancreatitis and sepsis. The patient was started on bicarbonate drip and had emergent hemodialysis. Despite mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis, his respiratory status continued to worsen, requiring high FiO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was a concern, so he was paralyzed with cisatracurium. The patient had a repeat dialysis session on day 2, to prevent refractory lactic acidosis and for fluid overload. After the second session of dialysis, his lactate levels improved to 3.8 mmol/L, creatinine decreased to 3.49 mg/dL, anion gap decreased to 16 mmol/L, arterial pH improved to 7.2, and bicarbonate improved to 18 mmol/L.

Over the next few days, his hospital course was complicated with supraventricular tachycardia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and acute liver failure. He continued to receive daily dialysis. His blood pressure and oxygen requirement started to improve. The sedation was tapered off on day 9, but he did not have any mental status. A CT scan of the head showed preserved white gray matter differentiation in the cortex and was negative for any acute pathology. An electroencephalogram showed generalized slowing related to ischemic and metabolic encephalopathy. Given the inability to wean the patient from the ventilator due to poor mental status and dependence on hemodialysis, his family decided to withdraw care. The palliative team was involved; the patient was terminally extubated and transferred to inpatient hospice. The patient died on day 14 of hospitalization. Later, the metformin levels on admission were revealed as 23 mcg/mL (the therapeutic concentration is 1-2 mcg/mL).

Our patient received aggressive treatment with mechanical ventilation, pressor support, and daily hemodialysis; yet he died. MALA is associated with high mortality. In a case series of 49 metformin-treated patients with lactic acidosis, mortality was 45%","Diagnosis:

Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients history of metformin use, acute kidney failure, and severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate levels strongly suggests MALA.

Suitable Treatments:
* Discontinue metformin, provide supportive care, and initiate hemodialysis to correct acidosis and remove metformin from the system"
"A 37-year-old male with a history of migraine, chronic back pain, seizure disorder, anxiety, and remote lower back spinal fusion surgery was brought to the hospital for headache, slurred speech, lethargy, visual hallucinations, and inability to get up from the floor.

"A 28-year-old Arabic female who was known to have allergic rhinitis and bilateral hearing loss was admitted to Al-Amiri Hospital in Kuwait due to status epilepticus for further investigation on 14 June 2022. The patient’s symptoms started early in the morning on the admission day. Initially, she had sudden intermittent bilateral blurry vision when she presented to the Al-Bahar Eye Center, and she was discharged as no abnormalities were found on the eye examination and her blurry vision partially improved. However, later in the evening, the patient had another attack of blurry vision mainly in the right eye with photophobia, two episodes of vomiting with food content, and severe headache. The patient’s family decided to take her to the hospital emergency room (ER). En route to the hospital, the patient lost consciousness and developed tonic‒clonic seizures in the car that lasted for 90 seconds. The seizures aborted spontaneously; however, the patient did not gain consciousness for 30 minutes. Upon arrival at the Al-Amiri ER, the patient was unconscious with vital signs including a temperature of 37.1 °C, a heart rate of 112 beats per minute (bpm), a blood pressure of 172/93 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 98%. Five minutes later, the patient had another tonic‒clonic seizure and was treated with diazepam, levetiracetam, and midazolam. Consequently, the seizure was terminated.

A medical history was obtained from the patient’s mother. She had a normal developmental history, but her history also revealed gradual hearing loss in both ears when she was 24 years old. Therefore, she attended a specialized speech and hearing center and was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss, and she has used a hearing aid device since the diagnosis. At the age of 26, the patient had a stroke-like episode where she developed a headache, right arm and leg weakness, and slurred speech. The patient presented to a nongovernmental hospital where a brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. A neurologist suspected that she may have autoimmune encephalitis and therefore started corticosteroid treatment with a methylprednisolone injection and discharged her on oral prednisolone for 5 days. The patient’s condition improved gradually, but she did not attend the follow-up.

Nonetheless, the patient reported memory impairment at the age of 27 when she became forgetful and was unable to remember recent events and days. Another neurologist in a different nongovernmental hospital reviewed her previous records and suspected a mitochondrial disorder and thus recommended further genetic testing. The patient was transferred to the Kuwait Medical Genetic Center for genetic testing but decided not to follow-up. Her family history revealed that the patient’s maternal grandmother died at age 40 following a stroke. Additionally, a positive history of hearing loss was noted in three of the patients’ aunts. Her mother reported a mild degree of bilateral hearing loss and biting her tongue several times (lateral side) when she woke up. However, she was never admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. The patient was an unmarried female who was not sexually active and had no history of smoking, drugs or alcohol abuse. The patient’s height was 1.50 m, her weight was 33 kg, and her body mass index (BMI) was 14.7 kg/m2.

After status epilepticus resolved, a full physical examination was completed, with nonsignificant findings. Additionally, arterial blood gas was performed on admission, which showed metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis) mixed with respiratory acidosis, with a blood pH of 7.19, pCO2 of 6.5 kPa, pO2 of 10.5 kPa, lactic acid of 11.4 mmol/L, and an HCO3 of 18.4 mmol/L. An urgent brain CT scan was also performed to rule out any acute central cause, and the results showed no evidence of acute brain insult. Given the recurrent seizures in a young female patient, meningoencephalitis needed to be ruled out. Therefore, a lumbar puncture was performed, and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample was taken for cell counting; protein, lactate, and glucose measurements; culture/sensitivity testing; and Gram staining (Table 1). Moreover, autoimmune screening was performed to rule out autoimmune encephalitis (Table 2). Additionally, blood samples were taken for a complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and renal function tests (RFTs), which returned nonsignificant results.

Because the lumbar puncture results ruled out an ongoing central nervous system (CNS) infection, an urgent brain MRI was performed, which showed left occipital, temporal, and parietal cortical and subcortical patchy areas of high signal intensity on T2 and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery Wigs (FLAIR WIGs) (Fig. 1). The radiologist’s impression was either status epilepticus-induced cerebral changes with subvolumic brain alterations due to the use of antiepileptic drugs or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADSIL) syndrome with left-sided cerebral ischemic lesions. After consulting the neurology team and reviewing the patient’s previous reports, MELAS syndrome was suspected. The patient and her family were advised to undergo genetic testing for MELAS syndrome mutation, which they accepted. After contacting the Kuwait Medical Genetic Center, the authors received a previous report from the center regarding the patient, which showed that the patient had undergone genetic testing 8 months ago but did not follow up on the results. According to the results, the patient is a carrier of the m.3243A>G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene in mitochondrial DNA, which is associated with MELAS syndrome. Following this discovery, a multidisciplinary team including internal medicine, neurology, genetics and metabolism, psychiatry, neuro-ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology clinicians met to discuss the current diagnosis, propose further management plans, and determine the prognosis.

Regarding the new-onset seizures, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, which showed a slow background with intermittent diffuse slowing, consistent with a mild degree of diffuse encephalopathy, and left hemispheric dysrhythmia likely related to a lesion on that side, where some frontal slow waves had a brush-like appearance. The patient was started on levetiracetam, as it is a safe option for patients with mitochondrial disorders. Seizures were controlled, and the patient had no other attacks. The genetics and metabolism team recommended that the patient start supportive treatment for the MELAS syndrome crisis. The treatment included intravenous arginine 0.5 g/kg diluted in 500 mL of 5% dextrose infused over 2 hours, followed by the same dose infused over 24 hours for 3 days. This treatment was followed by oral arginine 2000 mg once, coenzyme Q10 30 mg three times a day (TDS), vitamin C 500 mg TDS, and riboflavin 100 TDS. However, due to the unavailability of intravenous arginine, we started the patient with the arginine formula available in the hospital, namely, a 2 g arginine sachet, with the rest of the medication.

Next, the multidisciplinary team decided to evaluate the patient for the most serious complication related to MELAS syndrome. First, to rule out abnormal cardiac conduction abnormalities, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a 24-hour Holter study were performed, which showed a normal sinus rhythm with no arrhythmia. Second, regarding cardiomyopathy, an echocardiogram study was performed, and the report indicated concentric left ventricle remodeling with normal left ventricle systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation. For further evaluation, cardiac MRI was performed, which showed concentric mild left ventricular hypertrophy with no imaging signs of myocardial inflammatory or infiltrative changes.

Third, to rule out any abnormality associated with the endocrine system (that is, diabetes mellitus, abnormal thyroid or parathyroid function, and adrenal gland insufficiency), a hormone panel was sent (Table 3). Fourth, because the patient had intermittent blurry vision in the right eye, she was evaluated by a neuro-ophthalmologist. His findings were a normal fundus, slight disc pallor, and right homonymous hemianopia. A regular outpatient appointment was scheduled for follow-up. Fifth, the patient’s psychological and mental well-being was observed as she was extremely anxious, teary, devastated, and screaming in denial, especially after learning the news of her condition. Thus, further evaluation from the psychiatric team was requested. The psychiatric team assessed the patient’s case and reviewed her history. She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, after establishing a regular psychiatric visit, the patient’s mental well-being improved, and she was scheduled for regular follow-ups as an outpatient to proceed with cognitive behavioral therapy. Sixth, in terms of fluctuating hearing loss and new-onset hyperacusis, audiometry was scheduled, and an outpatient appointment was set with the otorhinolaryngology department for further evaluation.



After spending 2 weeks in the hospital and completing all the necessary investigations, the patient’s condition improved. Proper education was given to the patient and her family regarding the importance of regular follow-ups with each medical specialty involved in her case. Additionally, screening for carrier status in the patient’s mother and unaffected siblings was advised. The patient was discharged from the hospital with the same medication mentioned previously.","Diagnosis:

MELAS Syndrome

* Probability: Unknown
* Emergency: Very High
* Rationale: The patient is a carrier of the m.3243A>G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene associated with MELAS syndrome. The clinical presentation of recurrent stroke-like episodes, sensorineural hearing loss, lactic acidosis, and findings on MRI support this diagnosis. Seizures and metabolic abnormalities are common features.

Suitable Treatments:
* Antiseizure medications: But you should avoid valproate
* Coenzyme Q10 or L-carnitine: These products may increase mitochondrial energy output and slow the progression of MELAS syndrome
* L-arginine and L-citrulline: These products may decrease the number and effects of stroke-like episodes
* Insulin or metformin: This is used to treat diabetes
* Appropriate vaccines: People with MELAS syndrome should receive the necessary childhood vaccines, as well as annual COVID-19, flu and pneumonia vaccines
* Nonmedical treatments for MELAS syndrome
Your provider may also suggest an exercise routine for muscle strength and/or cochlear implants to help with hearing"
"A 31-year-old man, previously a healthy fitness instructor, presented to Accident & Emergency (A&E) at Mater Dei Hospital in Malta after collapsing during a 15-km obstacle marathon. On the day of the race, the temperature at noon in Malta was recorded as 30°C with 40% humidity. On presentation, the patient was tachypnoeic at 41 breaths per minute and had saturations of 98% on air. He was cardiovascularly unstable with a blood pressure of 68/30 mm Hg and a heart rate of 140 beats per minute. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 7 (Eyes-2, Verbal-2, Motor-3), and pupils were equal and reactive (3 mm). His temperature was 41.7°C (rectal). In view of his low GCS, the patient was intubated to protect his airway and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient was immediately cooled using ice packs, fans, paracetamol and bladder irrigation. The nasopharyngeal temperature decreased to 36.7°C within 1 hour of presentation. The patient was admitted to intensive therapy unit (ITU) for further monitorings.

Investigations
Laboratory analysis revealed multiple organ failures with a lactic acidosis (lactate 7.1 mmol/L, pH 7.43, HCO3 21.2 mmol/L, base excess −3.4 mmol/L), rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase 7482 U/L peaking at 9984 U/L) associated with hyperkalaemia (6.72 mmol/L), acute kidney injury (AKI) (serum creatinine 172 umol/L, urea 10.4 mmol/L), hepatic injury (bilirubin 51 mmol/L, ALT 3023 U/L) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (International Normalised Ratio 1.45, activated partial thromboplastin time 1.29, platelets 56×109/L, fibrinogen 1.0 g/L). Initial white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal.

An echocardiogram done at presentation showed no cardiac abnormalities but did demonstrate a collapsible inferior vena cava. Three litres of crystalloid were given to the patient while in A&E. Sinus rhythm was present on the admission ECG.

In view of the low GCS and one witnessed seizure on admission to ITU, a CT scan of the brain, MRI of the head, MRI angiography of the brain and MRI cerebral venogram were performed, and no abnormalities were seen.

The patient’s liver function continued to deteriorate while in ITU. He became clinically jaundiced as bilirubin levels continued to increase reaching a peak of 340 umol/L 10 days after admission after which they gradually decreased to 78 umol/L prior to discharge from hospital (29 days after admission). ALT was consistently above 1000 U/L during his ITU stay peaking at 9207 U/L. ALT levels gradually declined to 445 U/L on day 30. Ammonia levels were indeterminate because high bilirubin levels interfered with their calculation. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) remained raised throughout the patient’s hospital stay.

The patient developed worsening coagulopathy. Platelets dropped to 33×109/L, and the International Normalised Ratio (INR) increased to 4.5 on day 4. Both parameters remained deranged until day 8 when platelets rose to 192×109/L, and the INR dropped to 1.08.

Common aetiologies for acute liver failure were excluded including negative hepatitis serology (hepatitis A, B, C), negative viral screen (norovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, HIV PCR) negative urine toxicology screen (amphetamines, methamphetamines, opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), negative serum salicylate and paracetamol levels, negative liver ultrasound for macrovascular abnormalities and negative autoimmune screen (antigastric parietal cell antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, antismooth muscle antibody, liver microsomal antibody). CT liver excluded any anatomical abnormalities in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree.

Five days after admission, the CRP started to rise (73 mg/L), peaking at 160 mg/L on day 9. WCC gradually rose to 13.3×109/L. The patient was started on fluconazole and meropenem for broad spectrum antibiotic cover. Blood, urine, sputum, stool as well as mycology cultures were all negative. Because CRP gradually rose over 5 days, a CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed, but no sources of sepsis were found.

The patient had persistent agitation despite using multiple sedation protocols. A repeat CT of the brain was performed to rule out any organic causes for the confusion. No abnormalities were seen. Two EEGs confirmed metabolic encephalopathy. A lumbar puncture could not be performed because of the persistent coagulopathy.

Figures 1–6 display the trends in creatine kinase (CK), liver function (ALT, GTT, bilirubin, INR) and platelets during the patient’s admission.

Exertional Heat Stroke

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient’s presentation of hyperthermia (41.7°C), confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, altered consciousness (GCS 7), and collapse during intense physical activity in hot conditions strongly suggests EHS.

Suitable Treatments:

"A previously well 12-year-old boy presented with a four-day history of decreased energy and appetite. On day 3 of this illness, his parents noticed yellowing of his sclera and his urine was “dark” in colour. He was found to have elevated total and conjugated bilirubin, and elevated transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, with normal alkaline phosphatase. His albumin level was low, along with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), which did not respond to intravenous doses of vitamin K. He was found to have a low hemoglobin level, requiring packed red blood cell transfusions, with signs of nonautoimmune hemolytic anemia (low haptoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase levels and reticulocyte count, and negative Coomb’s test). There was no pruritus and no fever.

He had no sick contacts or pertinent travel history, no history of ingestion of acetaminophen or other drugs or naturopathic remedies, and no family history of liver disease. Serology for hepatitis A, B and C was negative. His urine toxicology screen was negative, total immunoglobulin G level was normal, and he had negative titres for antinuclear, antismooth muscle and antiliver kidney microsomal antibodies.

His blood and urine cultures were negative, and an abdominal ultrasound revealed no focal liver lesions, a normal biliary tree and patent hepatic veins.

The patient continued to deteriorate. By day 5 of his hospitalization, he had developed hepatopulmonary syndrome and encephalopathy, and required mechanical ventilation in the critical care unit. He was placed on the wait list for liver transplantation.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is defined by the presence of biochemical evidence of liver injury, with hepatic-based coagulopathy (INR >2.0 after parenteral replenishment of vitamin K, or INR >1.5 if encephalopathy is present) in the absence of evidence of chronic liver disease (1). It is an uncommon presentation in the previously well child. In general, symptoms are vague and include anorexia, fatigue and jaundice, while the underlying pathophysiology relates to loss of liver function and its subsequent sequelae (ie, coagulation abnormalities, encephalopathy, hemodynamic instability and renal failure) (2).

The differential diagnosis for ALF includes infective, toxic, autoimmune, metabolic and vascular causes, and varies according to age. In neonates and infants, gestational alloimmune liver disease, inborn errors of metabolism and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are the main causes of ALF. In older children, viral infections, drug-induced hepatotoxicity and autoimmune hepatitis are more common. Idiopathic ALF represents up to 50% of most reported cohorts (2).","Diagnosis:

Wilsons Disease

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: Wilsons Disease, a genetic disorder leading to excessive copper accumulation, can cause acute liver failure (ALF) in children and adolescents. The presence of hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low alkaline phosphatase are suggestive.

Suitable Treatments:
* Treatment of WD relies on copper chelation with penicillamine or trientine therapy, low copper diet and use of zinc to reduce copper absorption in the gut
* Zinc stimulates metallothionein production in enterocytes of the intestinal tract
* Metallothionein is a protein with great affinity for copper and, as such, copper is then excreted when the enterocytes naturally shed into the lumen of the intestinal tract (3)"
"A 73-year-old man was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of an academic health center in Boston for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in March 2020, during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 days before this transfer, when a dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue developed. Two days later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the emergency department at a local hospital. The temperature was 38.8°C, the blood pressure 94/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, he appeared well, and the lung sounds were clear. The white-cell count was 5600 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,500); 56% of the cells were neutrophils and 33% were lymphocytes. A nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to the Massachusetts State Laboratory for nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed owing to a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs.
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small (1 to 1.5 cm in diameter), rounded central and peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Figure 1A).
FIGURE 1


Oseltamivir was prescribed for the empirical treatment of influenza, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department and instructed to self-quarantine at home. During the next 4 days, his symptoms persisted; when dyspnea developed, he contacted his primary care physician and was referred back to the emergency department at the local hospital. The temperature was 38.6°C, the blood pressure 158/91 mm Hg, the heart rate 108 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, tachypneic, and distressed; auscultation of the lungs revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Intravenous propofol, cisatracurium, cefepime, and norepinephrine were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to an academic health center in Boston for further evaluation and management of symptoms.
On the patient’s arrival at the academic health center, his family was available to provide information regarding medical history, surgical history, and a recent review of systems by telephone. The review of systems was negative for conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, sinusitis, anosmia, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, and edema. The patient’s status with respect to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination was unknown. His medical history was notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. He had undergone surgical aortic-valve replacement for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis 1 year earlier; there had been no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on preoperative angiography. Radiofrequency ablation for recurrent atrial flutter had been performed 2 years earlier, and he had undergone right shoulder arthroplasty. Medications included metformin, insulin lispro, atenolol, losartan, and apixaban. Multiple statin medications had previously caused myalgia with elevated creatine kinase levels.
The patient was a health care worker but had no known sick contacts. No family members were ill. He had not traveled recently or had other environmental exposures. He did not use tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in multiple relatives; there was no history of pulmonary disease.
The patient was admitted to a dedicated Covid-19 ICU at the academic health center. The temperature was 38.9°C, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg while he was receiving intravenous norepinephrine, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal volume, 410 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The patient was sedated. There was no jugular venous distention. Auscultation of the chest revealed a tachycardic rhythm with no murmur and coarse breath sounds with rhonchi in both lungs. His arms and legs were cool and clammy. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Catheters were placed in the right internal jugular vein and the left radial artery. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The partial-thromboplastin time and blood levels of phosphorus and magnesium were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood sample was obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for nucleic acid testing for the detection of community-acquired respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
TABLE 1


An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest (Figure 1B) showed extensive confluent central and peripheral parenchymal opacities in both lungs. The central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein was in an appropriate position.
An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality, a borderline prolonged PR interval, ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads, ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL, PR-segment deviations (a depression in lead II and an elevation in lead aVR), and a corrected QT (QTc) interval of 425 msec. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, as well as dysfunction of the right ventricular free wall and the apex (see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). These findings were new relative to an echocardiogram that had been obtained 2 months earlier as part of routine surveillance after aortic-valve replacement, that had shown normal biventricular function. The size of the left ventricular chamber was normal. There was mild symmetric thickening of the left ventricular wall (12 mm; normal thickness, ≤11), a finding that was unchanged from the previous echocardiogram. No evidence of pericardial effusion was observed, and the bioprosthetic aortic valve was well seated and appeared to be functioning normally.
FIGURE 2","Diagnosis:

COVID-19 pneumonia

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presented with fever, dry cough, and fatigue during the COVID-19 pandemic. The chest CT showed ground-glass opacities, which are characteristic of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation further support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, and close monitoring
* Consider antiviral therapy (e.g
* , remdesivir) and immunomodulatory agents (e.g
* , dexamethasone) if available and indicated"
"41-year-old female referred with a history of increasing abdominal pain and jaundice since 2 weeks prior. The patient did not have any history of alcohol consumption, drug abuse, previous liver and biliary or hematologic diseases, transfusion, high risk sexual behavior, and recent travel to high risk regions for infectious diseases. The patient had diffuse abdominal pain that increased with eating and the sclera was icteric. There was no evidence of fever, diarrhea, constipation, ascites, hematemesis, hematochezia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or weight loss. Routine laboratory analysis revealed increased liver function test results, especially alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and direct bilirubin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Pancreatic enzymes were normal( Table 1).

Abdominal ultrasound evaluations reported a normal-size liver with increased tissue echo and mild dilatation of the intra- and extra-hepatobiliary ducts. Common biliary duct, portal system, and liver veins were normal. MRI imaging of the abdomen showed mild dilatation of the intra- and extra-hepatobiliary ducts(Figure 1). By taking into consideration the observed biliary duct dialatation and absence of any intra-hepatic conditions, we requested laboratory markers for viral hepatitis, hemachromatosis, Wilson’s disease, celiac, and primary biliary cirrhosis - all had negative results. Peripheral blood smear showed no evidence of hemolysis. Due to the high ALP, irregular dilatations and stenosis of the intra- and extra-hepatobiliary ducts and pancreatic duct results from MRCP, the presence of ANA and IgG4 were evaluated, both of which were both positive(Figure 2). Thus according to the association of clinical presentations that included abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice with the presence of specific autoimmune markers the patient underwent corticosteroid therapy, 30mg daily, with a diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis accompanied by autoimmune sclerosant cholangitis. At the one month follow up visit post-treatment, the control laboratory tests and MRCP revealed normal liver function results along with normal IgG4 and ANA, and normal intra- and extra-hepatobiliary ducts.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) imaging study showed mild narrowing and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, mild dialatation of the CBD, and irregularity of the pancreatic duct (arrows).

the most recent criteria for diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis has changed as follows:3

Imaging: diffused pancreas enlargement, segmental or diffused irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct.
Laboratory findings: increased IgG4, presence of autoantibodies.
Histopathologic findings: lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis.
Accompanied by other autoimmune diseases.
A definite diagnosis is defined by either criteria A+C, A+B, A+B+C, or A+B+C+D, whereas a probable diagnosis is the presence of criteria A+D and suspicion of disease is only criteria A.","Diagnosis:

Autoimmune Pancreatitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate to High (Requires immediate intervention to manage symptoms and prevent complications)
* Rationale: The clinical presentation of diffuse abdominal pain, icteric sclera, and increased liver function tests (especially ALP, bilirubin levels), and erythematous sedimentation rate (ESR) significantly suggests an autoimmune etiology. The presence of elevated IgG4 and positive ANA along with imaging findings (irregular dilatation and stenosis of biliary and pancreatic ducts) corroborate this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* First-line: Corticosteroids (e.g, Prednisone 30mg daily, then taper off)
* Alternative: Immunosuppressants (e.g, azathioprine) for patients who relapse or do not respond to steroids"
"A 58-year-old patient with chronic alcoholism presented with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. His vital signs revealed tachycardia, tachypnoea, and hypo­tension. On examination, he appeared to be in distress, and abdominal distension with tenderness over the epigastric region was observed. Laboratory work showed leukocytosis, thrombocytopaenia, acute kidney injury, and lactic acidosis. His lipase was elevated at 130,000 U/l. His liver chemistries were significant for bilirubin 2.4 mg/dl, aspartate transferase (AST) 322 U/l, alanine transferase (ALT) 125 U/l, and alka­line phosphatase of 93 U/l. His coagulation factors were pertinent for INR 1.5, prothrombin time 17.7 seconds, Aptt 17 seconds, fibrinogen 506 mg/dl, and fibrin degradation products (FDP) 20-40. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed peripancreatic fat stranding along with a wedge-shaped, peripheral hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe with typical morphology for hepatic infarction along with necrotising pancreatitis (Figs. 1-2). Splenic vein hyperdensity observed on the CT led to suspicion of splenic vein thrombosis, but there was no evidence of portal vein thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound of the liver confirmed patency of the hepatic vessels. CT-guided peripancreatic abscess aspiration grew Enterococcus and Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous (IV) piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated until he underwent a pancreatic necrosectomy after 90 days. Serial CT scans during the course of his hospitalisation confirmed gradual resolution of the hepatic infarction as his pancreatitis was resolving. Other aetio­logies such as hepatitis B were excluded.
Unfortunately, his hospital course was complicated by septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute renal failure, ultimately resulting in his death.
Hepatic infarction is a rare phenomenon due to the unique dual blood supply of the liver, provided by the hepatic artery and portal vein. ","Diagnosis:

"A 43-year-old male patient was admitted on July 3, 2023, without any obvious cause. He had yellow coloring of the body and eyes, yellow urine, yellow stool, no itching of the skin, no anorexia, no nausea and vomiting, no chills, no fever, and no abdominal pain. On July 22, 2023, the patient went to the outpatient clinic of the Shunde Hospital of the Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Guangzhou for diagnosis and treatment. His liver function was checked at the emergency clinic: Alanine aminotransferase 324.0 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 660.39 U/L, γ-glutamyl transferase 1173.96 U/L, total bilirubin 129.60 μmol/L, conjugated bilirubin 50.0 μmol/L, unconjugated bilirubin 27.10 μmol/L, and δ-bilirubin 52.50 μmol/L. White blood cell count was 13.61 × 109/L, absolute neutrophil count was 8.14 × 109/L. Hepatitis A antibody IgM, and five hepatitis B indicators were normal. Ultrasound showed a suspected solid focal lesion in the head of the pancreas (the nature of which was to be determined), dilatation of the upper portion of the common bile duct and intraductal bile ducts, and enlargement of the pancreas. Polyene phosphatidylcholine was given to protect the liver after symptomatic treatment, but without symptom relief. On July 24, 2023, the patient was hospitalized for further diagnosis and treatment. History of past illness The patient denied past medical history. Personal and family history The patient reported no significant abnormalities in his personal or family history. Physical examination Vital signs were stable, the whole body of the skin and mucous membranes showed moderate yellow stain, and the sclera showed mild yellow stain. The whole abdomen was flat, no gastrointestinal type and peristaltic wave, no epigastric pulsation, no varicose veins in the abdominal wall, soft abdomen, no abdominal pressure, no rebound pain, and no palpable mass.
Laboratory examinations There were no significant abnormalities in carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), α-fetoprotein, hepatitis C immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, autoimmune liver disease quantitative test, autoimmune liver disease antibody spectrum, and hepatitis E test. Imaging examinations Computed tomography (CT) plain scan, CT enhanced scan and reconstruction of the whole abdomen showed: pancreatic swelling and peripancreatic oozing (inflammatory changes suggestive of AIP); and dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Cholecystitis and prostate calcification were considered. At the time of admission, CT plain scan and enhanced scan of the whole abdomen showed swollen pancreas, and pericardium-like low density shadow at the edge with sheath-like changes. CT enhanced scan showed that the pancreatic ducts were not dilated, and peripancreatic oozing. There was no dilatation of the pancreatic ducts and some peripancreatic exudation. The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts were dilated and the gallbladder was slightly enlarged (Figure 1).





OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP The patients skin mucosa and eye color returned to normal. Liver function and bilirubin returned to normal. IgG4 gradually approached the normal range. The size of the pancreas was close to normal in imaging examination. The patient was recommended to undergo repeat pancreatic ultrasound elastometry.","Diagnosis:

Autoimmune Pancreatitis

* Probability: Medium
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: This is strongly suggested by imaging examinations which show pancreatic swelling and peripancreatic oozing, as well as dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, which are typical of AIP. Elevated γ-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase are consistent with cholestasis, which can occur in AIP. The patients symptoms and laboratory findings improved with immunosuppressive treatments, further supporting AIP.

Suitable Treatments:
* Corticosteroids: Prednisone or methylprednisolone to reduce inflammation
* Immunomodulatory Agents*: Azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil if there is a need for corticosteroid-sparing agents
* IgG4 Monitoring: Regular follow-up of IgG4 levels"
"78-year-old African American woman (Patient 1) presented to an outside hospital with acute hemorrhagic stroke in the left frontal and right parietal lobes. She had presented with sudden onset of expressive aphasia and right-sided hemiplegia. She had no past medical history, previous surgeries, allergies, was not on medication, and had no history of alcohol, tobacco or drug use.

The patient was eventually started on total parenteral nutrition due to inability to ingest anything by mouth. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed colonic distension with no evidence of mechanical obstruction (Figure 1). The patient then underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy that revealed no obstructing mass and resulted in removal of 4 L of stool. By this time, she had numerous rectal tubes placed without resolution.


Figure 1. CT scan of Patient 1 revealing colonic distension with no evidence of mechanical obstruction

She was transferred to our hospital on the 28th day after her stroke with worsening abdominal distension and discomfort due to colonic ileus without resolution. Her last bowel movement was prior to transfer. She continued to have flatus and denied nausea or vomiting. Her abdomen was soft, severely distended and diffusely tender to palpation. There was no fecal impaction on digital rectal exam.

Imaging showed increased colonic dilatation. A neostigmine bolus was given with no improvement. She had continued pain and distention with no flatus or bowel movements. Simethicone was started to prevent gaseous distension. Two days after the initial dose of neostigmine, a second dose was given with no improvement.

Colonoscopic decompression was performed at this point. The day after, she had a soft abdomen with no distension or tenderness to palpation and was better tolerating a full liquid diet. A couple of days later she had not yet had a bowel movement, oral intake remained minimal, and her abdominal distension worsened. The following week, she began to have flatus and bowel movements.","Diagnosis:

Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke in Bilobar Region

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High (Acute)
* Rationale: Patient presented with expressive aphasia and right-sided hemiplegia, which are consistent neurological deficits for stroke. CT imaging confirmed hemorrhagic stroke.

Suitable Treatments:
* Acute management with blood pressure control using antihypertensive medications like labetalol or nicardipine
* Neurosurgical intervention if needed, such as decompression
*  Anticonvulsant medication to manage seizure risk
*  Physical, occupational, and speech therapy for rehabilitation"
"A 66-year-old man (Patient 2) presented to an outside hospital with a stroke with right internal carotid artery occlusion at the neck and up to the middle cerebral artery. He had presented in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rhythm along with dysarthria and left-sided hemiplegia, but was outside the window for tissue plasminogen activator. He had a history of active alcohol abuse with daily consumption and tobacco use. He was not taking home medications and had no allergies. He was transferred to our hospital, where he underwent mechanical thrombectomy and right internal carotid artery stent placement.

The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing, and tube feeds were begun through a Dobhoff tube. Throughout this time, daily abdominal exams and X rays revealed gradually worsening abdominal distension with marked colonic and small bowel dilatation (Figure 2). The Dobhoff tube was replaced by a nasogastric tube for intestinal decompression. A CT scan and flexible sigmoidoscopy performed 14 days after his stroke showed no mechanical obstruction, consistent with a diagnosis of Ogilvie syndrome. Over time, the patient had numerous rectal tubes placed without resolution.


Figure 2. Abdominal X ray of Patient 2 revealing colonic and small bowel dilatation

The patient continued to have persistent colon distension and received a bolus of neostigmine. Two days later, an abdominal X ray showed mild decrease in colonic dilatation. Later that day, a second dose of neostigmine was given with no improvement.

Then colonoscopic decompression was attempted that revealed probable ischemic colitis at the splenic flexure, and this procedure was subsequently terminated due to concern for colonic perforation. The following CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no signs of perforation. The next day, abdominal X-ray imaging noted decreased colonic dilatation.

The occurrence of Ogilvie syndrome following a stroke is thought to be secondary to autonomic dysfunction,1likely with excess sympathetic stimulation and parasympathetic inhibition","Diagnosis:

Ogilvie Syndrome

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate to High
* Rationale: The clinical presentation, including marked colonic and small bowel dilatation without mechanical obstruction on imaging, and response to neostigmine supports the diagnosis of Ogilvie Syndrome. This condition is common after severe illnesses and major surgeries, often related to autonomic dysfunction.

Suitable Treatments:
* Colonoscopy may be used to remove air from the large intestine
* Fluids can be given through a vein to replace fluids lost from vomiting or diarrhea
* Nasogastric suction involving a nasogastric (NG) tube placed through the nose into the stomach can be used to remove air from the bowel"
"78-year-old woman presented with an altered level of consciousness and sudden onset of right-sided weakness. She was stuporous and there was severe weakness of the right limbs (right upper limb weakness of grade 1 and right lower limb weakness of grade 1; National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, 16 points). The time from the onset of the symptoms to the arrival at our hospital was 90 minutes. She had cardiac surgery for atrial septal defect with pulmonary valve stenosis 40 years ago. She did not a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia. Emergency computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography of brain confirmed an occlusion of the upper segment of the basilar artery (BA) and the right and left posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) due to thrombus formation. Thrombolytic therapy with a standard dose of IV tPA (0.9 mg/kg body weight) was promptly commenced. However, there weren’t any clinical improvements in the patient’s condition until the end of tPA infusion; therefore, intra-arterial (IA) thrombectomy with a Penumbra catheter was performed. With a right femoral approach, a dose of unfractionated heparin (1500 units) was intravenously administered and cerebral angiography was performed; complete occlusion of the distal BA was observed. A Penumbra catheter with a Prowler108 catheter was inserted into the distal portion of the BA through the right vertebral artery. Mechanical thrombectomy via the Penumbra catheter was performed with manual suction. After successful recanalization with this procedure, the patient’s symptoms dramatically improved: the NIHSS score improved to 3 points.

However, after an hour, the patient suddenly complained of severe abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed the presence of an acutely enlarged mass on the left side of the abdominal wall. The patient’s blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg and the heart rate was 102/min. Blood tests revealed hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 35.4% and platelet count of 205,000/mm3. Contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT image demonstrated a large intramuscular abdominal wall hematoma and active contrast extravasation within the hematoma, which was considered to be the focus of active bleeding (Figure ​(Figure1).1). To prevent further bleeding, selective arteriography was performed and the left inferior epigastric artery was identified as the source of active bleeding. The proximal part of the bleeding artery was embolized with polyvinyl alcohol (250 μm), and the mixture of histoacryl and lipiodril (Figure ​(Figure2).2). After the embolization, the patient stopped complaining of abdominal pain, and the abdominal wall hematoma stopped growing in size. During the rest of the hospitalization, her vital signs and hemoglobin level remained stable. On the 14th day, the patient was discharged home because she acquired a complete functional independence with only mild dysarthria (NIHSS score at the time of discharge was 1).

Vascular interventions such as IA thrombectomy can cause vascular rupture and bleeding. However, in this case, the IA procedure was performed via the right femoral artery, and the bleeding occurred from the left epigastric artery, which had originated from the left external iliac artery; therefore, it was likely to be related to the IV thrombolysis. Abdominal wall hematoma has been rarely reported in patients with deep vein thrombosis who underwent IV thrombolysis or long-term low-molecular-weight heparin therapy ","Diagnosis:

Acute Ischemic Stroke

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: Patient presented with an altered level of consciousness and focal neurological deficits (right-sided weakness). The NIHSS score was 16, which indicates a significant neurological impairment. Imaging confirmed occlusion of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries.

Suitable Treatments:
* The main treatment for an ischemic stroke is a medicine called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
* It breaks up the blood clots that block blood flow to your brain
* A healthcare provider will inject tPA into a vein in your arm
* This type of medicine must be given within 3 hours after stroke symptoms start"
"A 35-year-old Asian male presented to the hospital with a syncopal episode while he was walking home from a restaurant. He had two glasses of wine that evening but had been feeling dizzy and lightheaded in recent weeks. He did not have any significant past medical history and was not on any regular medication. He denied any palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath. He could not recall the syncopal episode fully and was found at the roadside by bystanders. On arrival at the hospital, his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with right axis deviation (RAD) and right bundle branch block (RBBB) (Figure 1).

Most blood tests including troponin T, creatinine kinase, HbA1c, immune screening tests such as complement levels, rheumatoid factor, proteinase 3 antibody, myeloperoxidase antibody, myocardial antibody, and cardiolipin antibody, thyroid function tests, creatinine kinase were within normal limits. Viral screening for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and COVID-19 was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 14 mm/hour (Normal range: 1-10 mm/hr). Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head and face showed a small fracture to the superior maxillary wall with overlying soft tissue swelling without any intracranial pathology. CT pulmonary angiogram showed florid centrilobular nodular opacification affecting the right upper and middle lobes, hilar lymphadenopathy, and anterior abdominal lymphadenopathy suggestive of possible tuberculosis (Figure ​(Figure2).2). Following further investigation and respiratory input, it was felt tuberculosis was highly unlikely. He was commenced on bisoprolol 2.5 mg once daily.

"previously healthy nine year-old girl presented to the authors’ institution (BC Children’s Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia) with a four-week history of fevers, vomiting, headache and abdominal pain. She was first seen in a community hospital following a 24 h history of fever followed by headache, emesis and a generalized erythematous, macular rash. Petechiae were not noted. A diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis was made. The rash subsided quickly but the remainder of her symptoms persisted.

Ten days later, she presented again to the same hospital with daily fevers, daily episodes of emesis and debilitating headaches. Her investigations included a normal complete blood cell count, and her urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli. She was discharged on cephalexin for five days; however, her symptoms failed to resolve.

She was subsequently referred and admitted to the authors’ tertiary care centre. Review of her history revealed daily fevers accompanied by severe nausea and emesis, along with severe headaches without photophobia. There was no history of recent travel or ill contacts. She denied night sweats, neck stiffness or joint pain. Her records indicated a 5 kg weight loss over four weeks.

Physical examination revealed a stable patient with normal vital signs. General examination was unremarkable and no neck stiffness or neurological deficit was detected.

Laboratory investigations on admission showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 11.2×109/L) and thrombocytosis (platelet count 423×109/L [normal range 150×109/L to 400×109/L]). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated (76 mm/h). Urine and blood cultures were negative.

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a large echogenic right kidney, suggesting possible pyelonephritis. A computed tomography scan of the head and a chest radiograph were normal.

A further investigation was performed to reveal the diagnosis.

Given the ultrasound results, a provisional diagnosis of partially treated urinary tract infection was made. To complete the diagnostic workup, a lumbar puncture was performed at 12 h of admission and before initiation of antibiotic therapy.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was cloudy, with an opening pressure of 38 cmH2O. Analysis of the CSF revealed a glucose level of <1.1 mmol/L, a protein level of 2.33 mg/L, white blood cell count of 1740×106/L and red blood cell count of 2×106/L. Polymerase chain reaction performed on the CSF was positive for Neisseria meningitidisserogroup B. The patient was started on intravenous cefotaxime and became afebrile within 12 h of therapy. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation of exposure and possible chemoprophylaxis of close contacts, the case was reported to the BC Centre for Disease Control (Vancouver, British Columbia). All symptoms resolved within 24 h to 48 h. She was discharged after completion of a seven-day course of intravenous cefotaxime. Of note, the patient was subsequently shown to have no complement deficiency, nor was she asplenic. At discharge, she was found to have moderately severe left-sided sensorineural hearing loss; this remained unchanged six weeks later.","Diagnosis:

Bacterial Meningitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presented with persistent fevers, severe headaches, and vomiting, with a history of a rapidly progressing and severe clinical course. A lumbar puncture revealed high opening pressure, low glucose, elevated protein, and high white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid, all indicative of bacterial meningitis. The positive PCR for Neisseria meningitidis confirmed the diagnosis.

"A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.
Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.
She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.
Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g., diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g., lymphoma), infectious (e.g., endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g., sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm3 (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm 3 , platelet count 88,000/mm 3, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly, mild gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. There were no gallstones or biliary ductal dilatation. Chest radiograph was normal. The patient was admitted for presumed cholecystitis and treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.

Marked thrombocytopenia may arise from acute infection or medication toxicity, but autoimmunity, hypersplenism or an infiltrative process of the bone marrow must also be considered. The urinalysis results are compatible with pyelonephritis, but there is no history of dysuria or costovertebral angle tenderness. Other explanations for the urinary findings include glomerulonephritis or urolithiasis. Endocarditis, via immune complex deposition, could cause this active urine sediment and involve the liver.

The laboratory tests point to a combined cholestatic and hepatocellular process. The AST to ALT ratio is compatible with alcoholic hepatitis, which can present with systemic toxicity and abdominal pain; therefore, revisiting the alcohol history would be logical here. Acetaminophen levels should be checked. The sonogram results, particularly the absence of gallstones, substantially lower the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, and the left-sided abdominal pain never really supported that diagnosis. Given the biochemical evidence of direct liver involvement and unexplained left upper quadrant pain, an abdominal CT is indicated.

She has a subacute illness associated with weight loss, night sweats, SIRS, prolonged fever, LUQ pain, hepatopathy and thrombocytopenia. Leading considerations include alcoholic hepatitis, SLE with autoimmune hepatitis, lymphoma or an indolent infection. Her travel to Mexico and potential involvement of the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow) renders tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g., histoplasmosis), endocarditis (especially if she has undiagnosed rheumatic heart disease) and brucellosis distinct possibilities. HIV testing is also indicated.

The clinician has explicitly articulated the revised problem representation in the first sentence of the paragraph above. The new data have triggered new hypotheses (e.g., alcoholic hepatitis) and eliminated earlier hypotheses (e.g., cholecystitis). The next diagnostic test (abdominal CT) is chosen to identify features that discriminate among the competing diagnoses.

CT of the abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly and a heterogeneous spleen with multiple small hypodense lesions (Fig. ​11 ). A hepatobiliary imino-diacetic acid (HIDA) scan was normal. The patient continued to have fevers. Further laboratory studies revealed negative hepatitis A, B and C serologies, negative HIV testing, and nonreactive RPR and PPD testing. Multiple blood and urine cultures were sterile after 2 days.

Object name is 11606_2010_1372_Fig1_HTML.jpg
Figure 1
CT images showing hepatomegaly and small hypodense lesions in the spleen (red arrows).

Acute cholecystitis has been excluded by a normal HIDA scan. The multiple hypodense lesions in the spleen point to an infiltrative or embolic process (causing microabscesses), and the liver enzymes implicate a similar process in the liver. The negative blood cultures substantially lower the probability of subacute bacterial endocarditis, but culture-negative endocarditis remains possible. Tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccioidomycosis, brucellosis, Q fever and bartonella infection can all present with granulomatous involvement of the liver and spleen, which would be consistent with the CT findings. Brucella is endemic to Mexico and presents with protean often nonlocalizing presentations, although she lacks the frequently noted osteoarticular manifestations (i.e., peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis or spondylitis). Further history is warranted to assess her risk for brucella or coxiella (e.g., livestock or unpasteurized dairy product exposures), bartonella (e.g., cat, lice or flea exposures, homelessness) or tuberculosis, and to definitively exclude recent antibiotic use, a common cause of culture-negative endocarditis. A negative RPR rules out disseminated syphilis unless the patient has a prozone phenomenon (an extremely high titer of treponemes that produces a false-negative test). Coccidioidomycosis serologies and a urine histoplasma antigen would be helpful as these infections are endemic to California and Mexico, respectively. Given the significant liver pathology with negative cultures and serologic testing to date, liver biopsy would be the logical next step for diagnosis.

The clinician is now postulating diagnoses that could account for the most discriminating features in this case: multiple small hypodense splenic lesions with fever, liver test abnormalities and hepatosplenomegaly. The framework has shifted to an “infiltrative or embolic process.” With the less invasive serologic tests and cultures failing to yield a specific diagnosis, the clinician recommends a liver biopsy.

Stool ova and parasite examination and stool and sputum AFB stains were negative. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-mitochondrial antibodies were negative. Anti-smooth muscle antibody (AMSA) was 1:40, and serum protein electrophoresis was normal. Core needle liver biopsy revealed hepatitis with infiltration with chronic inflammatory cells and non-caseating granulomas. Stains were negative for fungal and acid fast elements.

The negative ANA, normal protein electrophoresis and the low titer AMSA do not support a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. Granulomatous hepatitis is compatible with the aforementioned infections (TB, histoplasmosis, Q fever and brucellosis). It also is seen with noninfectious etiologies, such as lymphoma, sarcoidosis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Although the relevant cultures must be followed vigilantly, the negative mycobacterial and fungal stains, negative PPD and normal chest x-ray make tuberculosis and histoplasmosis less likely. The absence of lymphadenopathy (on exam or imaging studies) makes lymphoma and sarcoidosis unlikely. A history of animal exposure or evidence of valvular heart disease would support chronic Q fever, which looks remarkably similar to brucellosis. While no disease has been definitively excluded, brucellosis emerges as the leading diagnosis as it is endemic to Mexico and can account for a chronic febrile granulomatous illness involving the liver, spleen and possibly bone marrow.

The prioritization of a working differential diagnosis requires assigning probabilities to diseases that best explain the working problem representation (Table ​11 ).

On the 4th hospital day, blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital emergency room returned positive for Brucella melitensis. The patient was started on doxycycline and rifampin with rapid resolution of all symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Echocardiogram and urine histoplasmosis antigen were not ordered. Serologic studies for Coxiella burnetii were negative, and brucella serology later returned positive with IgM antibody levels of 3.53 IV (normal < 1.70 IV). She completed a 6-week course of antibiotics and did well. Further history revealed that when visiting her home in rural Mexico, she often milked the family cows.","Diagnosis:

Brucellosis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High (requires immediate treatment due to systemic involvement and risk of complications if untreated)
* Rationale: The patients travel history to Mexico, subacute febrile illness, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, multiple splenic lesions, and granulomatous hepatitis align closely with brucellosis. Blood cultures eventually confirmed Brucella melitensis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Medications: Doxycycline (200 mg per day in divided doses) and Rifampin (600-900 mg per day)
      - Duration: Typically 6 weeks
      - Monitoring: Regular follow-up for symptom resolution and laboratory monitoring"
" 29-year-old man was hospitalized for treatment of unremitting fever, malaise, and abdominal pain of 5 days duration. Initially, he was treated as an outpatient with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for acute sinusitis, without improvement in symptoms. He denied having headache, visual changes, or neck stiffness. He described a nonproductive cough and sinus congestion but denied experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, bowel changes, or bladder symptoms. He complained of anorexia but denied having weight loss, nausea, or vomiting. The patients medical history was remarkable only for a superficial gunshot wound to his upper extremity, with no resultant complications. He had no surgical history, was taking no medications, and had no drug allergies. He was originally from Somalia and had moved to the United States at age 21 years; he had not traveled since that time. He reported that he had been evaluated for possible malaria at the age of 19 years, for which he received no therapy. He used no alcohol, illicit drugs, or tobacco and denied having risk factors for the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis. He denied being exposed to cats, farm animals, insect bites, or animal feces. His family history was noncontributory. Immunization history revealed current hepatitis and diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccinations, with a negative purified protein derivative 1 year previously.
Physical examination showed a well-developed 29-year-old normotensive man with a temperature of 41°C and a heart rate of 123 beats/min. Findings on pulmonary and cardiac examination were normal. An abdominal examination revealed a liver palpable to 4 cm below the right costal margin with right upper quadrant tenderness, without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds were normal. No splenomegaly was evident. Findings on the rest of the physical examination were normal.
Laboratory studies yielded the following results (reference ranges shown parenthetically): hemoglobin, 12.8 g/dL (13.5–17.5 g/dL); sodium, 131 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L); potassium, 3.4 mEq/L (3.6–4.8 mEq/L); calcium, 8.4 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL); serum urea nitrogen, 13 mg/dL (6–21 mg/dL); creatinine, 1.1 mg/dL (0.8–1.2 mg/dL); chloride, 92 mEq/L (100–108 mEq/L); magnesium, 2.8 mg/dL (1.7-2.1 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase, 269 U/L (98–251 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 75 U/L (12–31 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 133 U/L (10–45 U/L); total bilirubin, 2.3 mg/dL (0.1–1.1 mg/dL); and lactate dehydrogenase, 159 U/L (92–202 U/L). The following were normal: leukocyte counts, platelet counts, coagulation studies, bicarbonate level, and anion gap. Urinalysis and Gram stain were negative; urine microscopy disclosed 1 to 3 erythrocytes and 1 to 3 leukocytes per high-power field. A chest x-ray film revealed a metallic shot in the patients right shoulder, but otherwise findings were normal.
Common presenting features of chronic cholecystitis include recurrent, intermittent abdominal pain; intolerance of high-fat meals; and periods of remission of symptoms. Episodes of nausea and vomiting are common; however, fever is rare. Physical findings include right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness and a positive Murphy sign. Our patients primary presenting symptoms were fever, chills, malaise, and constant abdominal pain. Thus, the diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis is possible but unlikely.
Common presenting clinical symptoms for lymphoma include fever, night sweats, and weight loss (B symptoms). Physical examination yields lymphadenopathy and hepato-splenomegaly. Our patient had fever but no night sweats or weight loss. No lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly was evident. Thus, lymphoma remains in the differential diagnosis but is unlikely.
The most common presenting symptoms of hepatic abscess are fever, chills, abdominal pain, and nausea or vomiting. Frequent physical findings include a temperature higher than 38.5°C, right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness, hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Our patient presented with fever, chills, and abdominal pain. On examination, he was febrile and had a palpable liver edge and right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness. Therefore, hepatic abscess is a likely diagnosis.
The clinical presentation of viral-induced hepatitis is frequently indolent, manifesting only as malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms. Low-grade fever is common, as is right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness. Anorexia and nausea may occur and are common in patients who develop jaundice. This prodrome of symptoms typically occurs over several days to several weeks. Liver transaminase elevations typically result in 5- to 30-fold increases above baseline. Our patient had malaise, fever, and right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness. He also had mild hepatic enzyme elevations; however, they were not to the degree commonly seen in patients with viral-induced hepatitis.
Patients with malaria frequently present with cyclic episodes of shaking chills, followed by fevers and sweats. Symptoms generally occur within 30 days of exposure but may occur months to years after exposure to non-Plasmodium falciparuminfections. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, headache, and myalgias are common. Delirium may accompany episodes of fever. Right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness and splenomegaly are common findings on physical examination. Although our patients presentation was consistent with malaria, he had no known exposure, and none of his family members or contacts were ill.
Our patients clinical presentation was most consistent with liver abscess. Diagnostic tests were ordered.","Diagnosis:

Hepatic abscess

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate medical attention required
* Rationale: The patient presents with fever, chills, abdominal pain, and right upper quadrant tenderness. He has a palpable liver edge and mildly elevated liver enzymes. This presentation is consistent with a hepatic abscess.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole) and percutaneous drainage of the abscess, if necessary"
"A 16-year-old healthy boy presented with a two-day history of pruritic painful rash involving his left abdomen and back in a T9 to T10 distribution. In addition, he had a fever, blurry vision, painful eye movements and a headache. The patient had a history of varicella-zoster virus infection without complications when he was eight years of age, and his past medical history was unremarkable. There were no sick contacts, and his vaccinations were current. He had not received the varicella vaccine.

On examination, his temperature was 37.4°C, his heart rate was 72 beats/min, his respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min and his blood pressure was 137/66 mmHg. He was alert with normal neurological findings, except for pain elicited on bilateral upward and extreme lateral gaze. There were clusters of six to eight slightly scabbed, erythematous papules in a left T9 to T10 distribution, with a single vesicular lesion noted over the left upper scapula. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.

Laboratory evaluation revealed a peripheral white blood cell count of 7×109/L (neutrophil count of 4.11×109/L and lymphocyte count of 2×109/L), hemoglobin level of 139 g/L, platelet count of 188×109/L and normal chemistry profile with a creatinine level of 62 μmol/L. The cerebral spinal fluid revealed a white blood cell count of 165×106/L with 97% lymphocytes, red bood cell count of 105×106/L, glucose level of 2.4 mmol/L and protein level of 0.83 g/L. The cerebral spinal fluid polymerase chain reaction was positive for varicella-zoster virus.

Intravenous acyclovir (30 mg/kg/day divided every 8 h) and cefotaxime (2 g taken intravenously every 6 h) were initiated. Intravenous fluid was started at 15 mL/h to maintain vein patency. Despite nursing description of minimal oral intake secondary to nausea, quantitative fluid balance was not documented. On day 2, the patient developed a truncal, erythematous, morbilliform rash. Cefotaxime was discontinued; however, the rash persisted for five more days. On hospital day 4, the patient developed hypertension ranging between 155/80 mmHg and 168/97 mmHg, and his creatinine level had increased to 203 μmol/L.

The renal insufficiency and resultant hypertension was believed to be secondary to acyclovir-induced renal toxicity, and the acyclovir was immediately discontinued. The hypertension and enlarged echogenic kidneys seen on ultrasound had both resolved by one month after discharge.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is uncommon in healthy children. The incidence of HZ ranges between 0.74 per 1000/year in children zero to nine years of age, and 10.1 per 1000/year in adults 80 to 89 years of age. Resulting from the reactivation of dormant varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the dorsal sensory root ganglia, HZ more commonly affects the elderly and the immunocompromised. Risk factors for HZ in immunocompetent children include intrauterine and infantile (younger than one year of age) VZV, due to decreased specific cellular immunity and subsequent prolonged viremia.

In children, HZ is generally characterized by minimal pain and pruritis. Lesions appear as clusters of vesicles involving sensory dermatomes that crust over the following week. In contrast to adult HZ, postherpetic neuralgia is rare in children. The distribution of HZ is variable and depends on the health status and age of the child; dissemination is more common in immunocompromised individuals. Our patient, although healthy, presented with a rash involving his left, lower thoracic and cervical dermatomes. He also had evidence of central nervous system involvement.

Although rare, aseptic meningitis has been documented in healthy children with HZ infection. Approximately 30% to 50% of HZ patients have pleocytosis in the cerebral spinal fluid. In general, these reports involve children whose primary VZV occurred before one year of age. Our patient, however, developed aseptic meningitis with his HZ, despite having contracted chickenpox at eight years of age. This is an unusual presentation because our patient’s history was not suggestive of an immunodeficiency.

The diagnosis of HZ is based on clinical findings, direct fluorescent antigen, Tzanck smear, serology or viral culture. In addition, molecular testing (real-time polymerase chain reaction) can differentiate wildtype from vaccine strains of varicella virus. Once diagnosed, the indications for acyclovir therapy include immunocompromised children, trigeminal involvement of HZ, Ramsay Hunt syndrome and meningoencephalitis. Healthy children with an uncomplicated course of HZ do not usually require antiviral therapy.

Documented adverse effects associated with acyclovir include mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Rare side effects include neurological, hematological, hepatic and renal toxicity. Several cases of acute renal failure have been reported, usually in the context of fluid restriction to prevent cerebral edema in patients with encephalitis. The combination of ceftriaxone and high-dose acyclovir may further increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Our patient, without purposeful fluid restriction, developed acute renal failure after four days of intravenous (IV) acyclovir therapy. Cefotaxime was discontinued within 24 h of hospitalization, once cerebral spinal fluid viral polymerase chain reaction results were obtained. Decreased oral fluid intake, combined with inadequate IV hydration, may have contributed to the development of renal insufficiency in our patient. Important factors that have been identified in avoiding nephrotoxicity when using IV acyclovir include, making sure that it is dosed by ideal body mass (and not just body weight), that the patient is optimally hydrated (usually recommend 1.5 times maintenance, unless fluid restricted), and close monitoring of urine output (minimal 1 mL/kg/h), accurate ins and outs, daily weight and serum creatinine. The use of concurrent nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and the dose of acyclovir must be adjusted for any renal impairment.","Diagnosis:

Herpes Zoster

Suitable Treatments:

"A previously healthy young woman presented with a 3 to 4 day history of fever, headache and a maculopapular rash that also affected her palms. She was in a stable condition and was admitted for observation and further investigations without initiating antibiotic treatment. During the next two days her condition improved spontaneously, and her symptoms were initially interpreted as a viral infection. On day 3, blood cultures taken on the day of admission came back positive for Streptobacillus moniliformis, the causative agent of rat-bite fever. A more detailed patient history was taken, and the patient reported that she had several pet rats and one of them had given her some superficial scratches a few days before she fell ill.
Rats and other rodents are often colonised by Streptobacillus moniliformis in their oropharynx. Many people keep such animals as pets, and it is important to be aware of this disease as a differential diagnosis when a patient presents with fever and rash. Untreated, the disease might have a fatal course and the treatment of choice, penicillin, is usually easily available.

Upon admission, she had blood pressure of 118/82 mm Hg, a regular heart rate of 96 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 19 per minute. Oxygen saturation was 100 % in room air and she had an axillary temperature of 36.2 °C.

Examination revealed a maculopapular exanthema on the volar surface of the forearms and on both palms, as well as a small vesicle on the left thumb (Figure 1). There was no enanthema in the oral cavity or exanthema on the soles of the feet. Clinical examination showed no other abnormal findings. The cause of the symptoms was unclear, and the patient was admitted to the observation ward for further investigation.



Figure 1 Exanthema on the patients left palm.
Maculopapular exanthema, which can also affect the palms and possibly the soles of the feet, can be caused by a variety of microbiological agents, drugs, malignancies and systemic diseases. Box 1shows some of the key infectious agents and conditions that are typically responsible for such a rash in patients who become ill in Europe .

The patient had not been taking any medications prior to becoming ill, so a drug-induced condition was considered unlikely. There were no clinical signs of a systemic bacterial infection, and therefore meningococcal disease and toxic shock syndrome were not regarded as differential diagnoses. The patient did not have a heart murmur, and the appearance of the exanthema was inconsistent with endocarditis. She had not been travelling abroad, and therefore the cause of the symptoms was not thought to be an imported disease.
A drug rash should be considered a potential cause if the patient has taken or is taking any medications. Various haematological and oncological conditions can also cause exanthema affecting the palms and the soles of the feet (e.g. cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, mastocytosis and erythromelalgia). Other possible causes include underlying systemic inflammatory conditions (e.g. adult-onset Stills disease, acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, reactive arthritis and Kawasaki disease).

Preliminary blood tests showed CRP 222 mg/l (reference <6 mg/l), leukocytes 13 ∙ 109/l (3.5–11.0 ∙ 109/l), neutrophilic granulocytes 9.2 ∙ 109/l (1.9–8.0 ∙ 109/l) and monocytes 1.32 ∙ 109/l (0.20–1.0 ∙ 109/l), but a normal differential count and no other abnormalities. Chest X-ray was normal. Urine dipstick testing performed in the out-of-hours primary health care service had shown 2+ for blood and 1+ for protein.

A nasopharyngeal specimen was obtained to test for respiratory viruses and atypical bacterial agents (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae), along with a sample to perform serological testing for herpes simplex, varicella zoster and parvovirus. A sample from the small vesicle on the left thumb was sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus and enterovirus. Serological testing for syphilis was not performed, as this was not considered a likely diagnosis based on the medical history and clinical presentation.

We suspected the patients symptoms had a viral origin and therefore chose not to initiate antibiotic treatment immediately.

The evening of her admission, the patient developed a fever of 38.2 °C, and two sets of blood cultures were taken. Over the course of the night her headache intensified and her temperature rose to 39.1 °C. The maculopapular exanthema worsened and could now be seen on both lower extremities and on parts of the trunk. She had mild tachycardia, with a heart rate of 106 beats/min, but otherwise stable vital signs. She was given 1 g paracetamol orally. Additional blood cultures were taken and she remained under observation, but antibiotic treatment was not initiated.

The patient was assessed and was judged not to have sepsis, but it was still unclear whether her symptoms had a bacterial aetiology. She was mentally alert, with no incipient neck stiffness and her respiratory rate was normal. The doctor on duty felt that delaying the use of antibiotics was still justified as the patient was under observation.

She was mentally alert, with no incipient neck stiffness and her respiratory rate was normal. The doctor on duty felt that delaying the use of antibiotics was still justified as the patient was under observation.

The following day, the patients general condition was good and she was afebrile. Her CRP level had decreased somewhat (from 222 mg/l to 194 mg/l) and her leukocyte count fallen slightly (from 13 ∙ 109/l to 11.8 ∙ 109/l).

A urine culture showed gram-positive mixed flora (1 000–10 000 CFU/ml). However, as the patient had no symptoms of a urinary tract infection, this was interpreted as contamination. Urine dipstick testing showed 1+ for protein and 1+ for glucose, but was negative for blood. Because the diagnosis was still unclear, the patient was transferred on day 2 from the observation ward to the infectious diseases department.

On day 3 she remained afebrile. A further spontaneous drop in CRP levels had occurred to 106 mg/l, and her leukocyte count had fallen to 9.4 ∙ 109/l. On arrival, the patients occupational history had not been noted in her medical records, and upon questioning, it now emerged that she worked as a veterinary nurse in a veterinary clinic. She denied having experienced anything out of the ordinary at work, including bites or scratches, in the time leading up to her illness. She was not asked at this point whether she had any pets or whether she had had contact with animals outside of work. The patient now considered herself almost restored back to normal health. Her rash had improved slightly and no new lesions had appeared in the last 24 hours. She was showing spontaneous clinical and biochemical improvement, and we believed a viral aetiology was most likely. We considered discharging the patient, but later that day a telephone message from the microbiology section reported the growth of gram-negative rods in three of four blood culture bottles. Intravenous treatment with cefotaxime 2 g × 3 was therefore initiated while waiting for the final identification of the bacterium.

There was no explanation in the medical records as to why treatment was not started, in line with the Norwegian national guidelines for antibiotic use, with gentamicin and benzylpenicillin. When the aim is to cover the most common gram-negative agents found in blood cultures in Norway, E. coli and Klebsiella spp., gentamicin is usually a better choice than cefotaxime as there is somewhat less resistance to the former (2). However, infection with the most common gram-negative rod bacteria would still not be able to explain the patients rash. One possibility is that because the focus of the infection and the agent were unclear, a drug with a gram-negative spectrum but better tissue penetration than gentamicin was chosen.

The following day, the microbe was identified as Streptobacillus moniliformis using MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry). This instrument uses mass spectrometry to detect protein fragments belonging to microorganisms on the basis of their molecular mass and charge. The microbial proteins are fragmented and ionised, and the molecular mass of free ions is detected in a vacuum chamber. The spectral protein pattern of the microbe is then compared to established protein patterns from known microorganisms in a database (3).

The microbial proteins are fragmented and ionised, and the molecular mass of free ions is detected in a vacuum chamber.

Samples taken on arrival for PCR and serological testing were negative for relevant viral agents.

Notably, the two extra blood cultures that were collected prior to treatment initiation, because of a fever peak of 39.1 °C the night the patient was hospitalised, showed no bacterial growth.

The patient was treated with intravenous cefotaxime 2 g × 3 for three days as an inpatient. On day 5 of her hospital stay, the resistance profile was available and the patients general condition was good. Treatment was therefore switched to intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g × 1 for a further four days after discharge.

Although there are no established breakpoints for S. moniliformis, this can be considered appropriate treatment based on the available literature and the resistance profile for the isolate in question.

Ceftriaxone was chosen over benzylpenicillin primarily for logistical reasons, as the patients general condition was good and she did not need to be in hospital. Because she lived far away from the hospital, it would have been impractical for her to travel back and forth to receive intravenous benzylpenicillin four times a day. After a week, she was switched to peroral therapy, specifically phenoxymethylpenicillin 1 g × 4 for a further seven days.

There were no joint manifestations, no signs of serositis, and no respiratory or circulatory symptoms in the subsequent disease course. No additional follow-up was scheduled by the hospital following the completion of antibiotic treatment. During a telephone conversation many months later, she reported that she had not experienced any symptoms or signs of relapse, and that she continued to keep rats as pets.","Diagnosis:

Rat-Bite Fever

* Probability: High (Confirmed by blood culture)
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: Patient had pet rats and history of superficial scratches. Blood cultures confirmed the presence of Streptobacillus moniliformis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Initial: Intravenous cefotaxime 2 g × 3
     - After identification: Intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g × 1 for four days
     - Oral follow-up: Phenoxymethylpenicillin 1 g × 4 for seven days

"A 21-year-old man with a history of adult-onset Stills disease (AOSD) presented to the emergency room with a 10-day history of fever with a maximum temperature of 40°C, headaches, joint pain, rash, and vomiting. His rheumatologist advised him to stop taking adalimumab until any underlying infection was ruled out. He was thought to have a flare of Stills disease and was advised to continue methotrexate (MTX) and prednisone 60 mg daily. He did not improve and after 3 days was admitted and given intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). He initially felt better, but when the dose of IVMP was decreased, joint pain, fever, and rash returned. Laboratory tests from the initial admission are shown in Table 1. Peripheral blood smear showed atypical lymphocytes. Creatine kinase, hepatitis panel, and chest radiograph were unremarkable.","Diagnosis:

Macrophage Activation Syndrome

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High (life-threatening if untreated)

"La paziente (56 anni) si è presentata in un ospedale con sonnolenza, vertigini, rallentamento cognitivo e forti mal di testa episodici ricorrenti. I sintomi erano iniziati due giorni prima. In precedenza era stata ricoverata nello stesso ospedale per colangite e sindrome lombare cronica esacerbata da dipendenza da oppiacei. In quelloccasione, la terapia del dolore era stata modificata per passare dallossicodone e morfina alla buprenorfina; prima della dimissione le era stata prescritta anche la duloxetina.

Risultati e decorso
Paziente in buon compenso cardiopolmonare;
stato neurologico nella normae;
pressione arteriosa sistolica elevata (170 mmHg) con ipertensione sconosciuta.
Poiché la paziente aveva riferito di essere stata trattata contemporaneamente con ossicodone, morfina e buprenorfina, i sintomi erano stati inizialmente interpretati come il risultato di unintossicazione da oppiacei.

Un giorno dopo il ricovero, le vertigini erano scomparse. Tuttavia, da due giorni erano presenti anche forti mal di testa, con una durata di circa 3-4 ore, che non rispondevano agli analgesici (paracetamolo e metamizolo, oltre agli oppiacei citati). Secondo gli autori, il mal di testa era diverso dalla ben nota emicrania con aura. La donna aveva anche riferito di aver assunto rizatriptan per diversi giorni. La TC cerebrale per escludere unemorragia intracranica non aveva dato risultati significativi.

Durante la degenza la paziente ha nuovamente sviluppato deficit neurologici fluttuanti tra cui un disturbo percettivo del lato sinistro del corpo, una perdita di tono delle estremità sul lato sinistro, vertigini intermittenti e rotazionali e un rallentamento cognitivo.

Le diagnosi iniziali sospettate erano: disturbo dissociativo o nuova emicrania con aura.

Ulteriori analisi hanno mostrato:

RM cerebrale: ischemia cerebrale recente ma già delimitata in più aree di flusso; presenza di due stenosi di breve estensione nellarteria cerebrale anteriore (ACA) sinistra e una stenosi di breve estensione nellarteria cerebrale posteriore.
Ecodoppler: lieve ateromatosi dei vasi extracranici che riforniscono il cervello e diverse accelerazioni segmentarie del flusso intracranico nellACA a destra, nellarteria cerebrale media su entrambi i lati e nellACA su entrambi i lati.
Risultati del liquor e screening sierologico per vasculite: non significativi.
Ecocardiografia transtoracica e transesofagea: nessuna evidenza di embolia di derivazione cardiaca.","Diagnosis:

"A two-month-old girl was transferred from a local hospital to the pediatric ICU of a tertiary hospital because of cough and wheezing for 10 days, which worsened after six days. The child had a history of asphyxia and weak physical condition. She was diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia and was hospitalized for seven days at another hospital.
On admission, the infant had an acute facial appearance, with anhidrosis on the left side of the face, hyperhidrosis on the right side, tachypnea, and three depressions sign. After oral ibuprofen administration and physical cooling, the body temperature decreased slowly. When fever was high, the patient experienced convulsions, cough, wheezing, and diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) performed at another hospital revealed a high-density shadow in the right lower lung and a large soft tissue mass in the posterior mediastinum. Enhanced CT tomography revealed a space-occupying lesion in the posterior mediastinum. Combined with the results for neuron-specific enolase (71.72 ng/mL), the possibility of neuroblastoma was considered. The patient subsequently underwent mediastinal tumor resection under general anesthesia, and the surgery was successful. The child had persistent symptoms, such as fever, convulsions, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness, postoperatively. After the relevant examinations, paraneoplastic syndrome was considered, and isotretinoin was administered orally to induce tumor differentiation.

The child had multiple infections during hospitalization. After admission, the result of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae nucleic acid test of the throat swab was 4.024×E5Copies/mL, indicating the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Subsequent bacterial culture of the tracheal tube tip suggested hemolytic Staphylococcus, indicating the presence of bacterial infection. The1–3 -β-D-glucan test was 160.79pg/mL, and Aspergillus galactomannan test was 0.35ug/L, indicating fungal infection. To control and prevent further infection, a variety of antibiotics, such as cefotaxime sodium, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefoperazone sulbactam sodium, azithromycin, vancomycin, meropenem, linezolid, voriconazole, and metronidazole, are used throughout the hospital stay. During the third month of hospitalization, the patient’s sputum smear showed a large number of gram-positive bacilli outside the white blood cells on Gram staining (Figure 1A) and weak acid-fast staining was positive (Figure 1B). The sputum culture grew dry, rough, branched, and slightly yellow-pigmented colonies on Columbia Blood Agar Base Medium (Figure 1Cand D). MALDI-TOF MS of Merieux VITEK MS identity the colonies as Tsukamurella species (Figure 2A), and the DNA (Ezup column bacterial genomic DNA extraction kit, sangon Biotech, Shanghai) of the bacterial strain was extracted for 16S rRNA sequencing (sangon Biotech, Shanghai), and the base pair matching of the sequencing results showed that the Query Cover 99%, E value 0.0, per.ident 99.80%. After sequencing and comparing the results, the colony from the sputum was determined to be Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens, which was subsequently cultured from the tracheal apex catheter of the patient. MALDI-TOF MS compared with 16S rRNA, time and cost advantages, but can only be identified to species level, and there is a certain error detection rate.4Unfortunately, despite active treatments, such as anti-infection, immune regulation with gamma globulin, methylprednisolone pulse therapy, intravenous nutritional support, and invasive ventilator-assisted ventilation, the patient’s family required abandonment of treatment due to her critical condition and threatened life. The patient was discharged with a stomach tube during the third month of hospitalization.


Figure 1 (A) The Gram stain of the specimen was a cluster of blue-purple, indicating that the organism was Gram-positive bacilli. (B) Weak acid-fast staining was red, indicating that the bacteria was positive for weak acid-fast staining. (C) Dry, rough, and branched bacterial colonies with a little yellowish pigment appeared on the blood agar plate. (D)Under the microscope, the colony morphology was clear.

Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens is an aerobic, weakly acid-fast, non-motile, gram-positive bacterium that colonizes various environments and can infect immunocompromised patients. Confusions are easily made when distinguishing between Actinomycetes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens. After culturing pure colonies of this strain, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the gradient diffusion method were performed (Table 1). DNA of the strain was extracted and sent for high-throughput sequencing (Uniteomics, Tianjin). Basic genomic information was also analyzed.

"A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with intermittent diarrhea for the previous 5 d, which developed soon after eating food that he believed was contaminated. He also had reduced urine volume for the previous 3 d (Table ​(Table11).

Physical examination
Examination on admission showed that his temperature was 38.5 °C, pulse was 128 beats/min, respiration was 22 breaths/min, and blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg. There was no evidence of lung or cardiac abnormalities. His abdomen was slightly puffy and soft, with upper abdominal pressure, and he experienced back pain and bowel “chirping” 5-6 times/min.

Laboratory examinations
His hemoglobin level was 18.3 g/dL, the total white blood cell count was 21.4 × 109/L, there were 71.9% neutral granulocytes, and the platelet count was 169 × 109/L. The patient also had metabolic acidosis, with a blood gas pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 30 mmHg, PO2 of 66 mmHg (FiO2 60%), PO2/FiO2 of 110 mmHg, bicarbonate of 16.6 mmol/L, a base excess of -9.0 mmol/L, and lactate of 3.5 mmol/L. The aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) was 573.1 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 47 U/L, total bilirubin was 7.58 µmol/L, serum creatinine (SCr) was 708.8 µmol/L, urea was 20.48 mmol/L, and albumin was 26.9 g/L. The prothrombin time was 12.5 s, activated partial thromboplastin time was 31.3 s, international normalized ratio was 1.08, and procalcitonin (PCT) was 32.60 ng/mL. Because the ASP was highly elevated and the AST was moderately elevated, we conducted tests to determine the possible cause. All tests for hepatitis (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb, and HCV) were negative, as were all tests for autoimmune hepatitis (antinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antigen, soluble liver antigen antibodies, liver-kidney microsome-1, and other autoantibodies).

Salmonella and Shigella were not detected in a stool culture, and the tests for Clostridium difficile toxin A toxin B were also negative. Most fecal cocci were Gram-negative bacilli, and there were a few Gram-positive.

Empirical treatment with meropenem began within 1 h of admission, and blood cultures were obtained. The blood culture showed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to meropenem, so we continued its use.

According to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)[6], we diagnosed the patient as having Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia, sepsis, septic shock, and septic AKI. His Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was 18 points, with a 42.9% risk of death, and his Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 10.
The patient was in critical condition. To treat the sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, we administered 2500 mL of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 h and established invasive dynamic hemodynamic monitoring. Following the initial fluid resuscitation, we performed frequent reassessment of his hemodynamic status to guide administration of additional fluids. The patients blood pressure increased slightly to 80/55 mmHg, and we administered noradrenaline to achieve the initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg.

We also initiated CRRT using an oXiris®hemofilter (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, United States), which is designed for removal of cytokines adsorption of endotoxins, using a Prismaflex version 8.0 machine (Gambro Industries, Meyzieu, France). A vascular path was established using a 12-French double-lumen catheter in the right femoral vein. The prescription was set up as pre-dilution. The mode of CRRT was continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at 30 mL/kg per hour, and the CRRT machine was primed with normal heparinized saline and regional citrate for anticoagulation. The blood flow rate was 150 L/min. The hemofiltration prescription was adjusted based on electrolyte and acid-base results and the oXiris® hemofilter was changed every 12 h to ensure adsorption efficacy. Except for mild hypocalcemia, which required intravenous calcium supplementation, the patient experienced no significant complications.

After administering meropenem and CRRT with the oXiris® filter for 72 h, the patients vital signs were stable, and the infection was well controlled. We also reduced the noradrenaline infusion to a minimum of 0.05 µg/kg per minute during the CRRT, and stopped it at 65 h after initiation of treatment (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A). After 6 h, the lactate level was 2.1 mmol/L and lactate clearance rate was 40%. At that time, inflammation-related parameters [endotoxin, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10] had markedly declined (Figure ​(Figure1B1B-​-D).D). In addition, the PCT level decreased from 32.60 ng/mL to 4.98 ng/mL during the 72 h treatment period (Figure ​(Figure2A).2A). His urine volume gradually increased over the course of 10 d (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B). Over the course of 3 d, his SCr gradually decreased from 708.8 µmol/L to 241 µmol/L, his SOFA score decreased from 10 to 3 (Figure ​(Figure2C),2C), and his APACHE II score decreased from 18 to 6 (Figure ​(Figure2D).2D). After he was hemodynamically stable, we changed to a traditional filter (AN69 hemofilter) and used intermittent CVVHDF. We discontinued CRRT after the recovery of kidney function on day 20. After 25 d of treatment in the ICU, there was significant amelioration of the septic shock, and we discharged the patient. The patients kidney function eventually returned to normal.","Diagnosis:

Septic shock due to Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presented with signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension) and had a positive blood culture for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The presence of septic shock is supported by the patients hemodynamic instability and the need for vasopressor support.

Suitable Treatments:
* Broad spectrum antibiotic (change to specfic antibiotic after colture analisis), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), norepinephrine to mantain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg (adding vasopressin in case of refractory shock),"
"63-year-old Aboriginal man was referred by a general practitioner to a rural hospital emergency department. The patient presented with 24 hours of epigastric pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea, generalized muscle aches, and fever. The preceding night, the patient had eaten a piece of chicken that he had cooked after it had been refrigerated for a few days. The patient was an ex-smoker, was moderately obese, and had long-standing type 2 diabetes being treated with insulin and complicated by diabetic nephropathy (baseline serum creatinine 300–320 μmol/L) and peripheral vascular disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II symptoms), hypertension, and depression. Over the preceding 2 years, he had been managed in the outpatient heart failure clinic with review every 6–8 weeks. His heart failure symptoms had been deemed to be stable at his last review 6 weeks before presentation. The patient’s regular medications were low-dose aspirin, bisoprolol, fluvoxamine, gliclazide MR, insulin glargine, fenofibrate, simvastatin, and inhaled fluticasone/salmeterol. The patient lived alone and was functionally independent with activities of daily living.

Upon presentation to hospital, his initial examination was remarkable only for fever. Blood biochemistry showed raised inflammatory markers and chronically elevated creatinine (Table 1). The patient was admitted to the general medical ward of a rural district hospital for supportive treatment with a presumptive diagnosis of infective gastroenteritis. Initial management included intravenous fluid rehydration and antiemetics. His fluid status was monitored, and his regular medications, including insulin and inhaled bronchodilators, were continued.



Over the next 24 hours, the patient continued to have intermittent high fevers. Empirical antibiotics were commenced (intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g three times daily). Blood cultures subsequently grew C. perfringens and E. avium; both organisms were sensitive to penicillin. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated cholelithiasis but was otherwise normal (Fig. Fig. 1). Specialist infectious disease advice was sought on two occasions, which confirmed appropriate antibiotic management. The patient continued to remain clinically stable.

Fig. 1
figure 1
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in a patient with suspected gastroenteritis. Image was obtained within 24 hours of presentation to the hospital. CT demonstrated cholelithiasis but no other abnormality

Viral nasopharyngeal swabs were also positive for human metapneumovirus. The results of fecal nucleic acid testing were negative for other common pathogenic organisms, including enteric viruses, parasites, and bacteria. The results of viral and autoimmune hepatitis screening were negative. Urine culture performed prior to initiating antibiotics was clear. Blood film obtained 48 hours after admission showed neutrophilic toxic changes.

On the third day after presentation, the patient became visibly jaundiced and complained of mild intermittent epigastric pain. Blood biochemistry showed acute renal and hepatic injury and hyperbilirubinemia suggestive of intravascular hemolysis (Table 1). The patient was urgently transferred to a tertiary center, given the risk of deterioration.

The patient’s condition significantly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was admitted to intensive care with septic shock and renal failure. He required support with multiple inotropes and dialysis. Antibiotic cover was extended to include vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin (Table 2). Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small bowel enteritis, hepatic infarction, and portal vein thrombosis suspected to be septic thromboembolism. CT also demonstrated several hepatic hypodensities consistent with multiple abscesses, the largest measuring 41 mm in diameter (Fig. 2). Ultrasound-guided drainage was performed, and 35 ml of hemoturbid fluid was aspirated. The result of culture of the hepatic abscess was positive for E. avium.


Fig. 2
figure 2
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis 72 hours after presentation to the hospital showing multiple lobulated intrahepatic collections, infarction of hepatic segments 5 and 8, and septic occlusion of the portal vein. There were no gas locules associated with the abscesses. CT also demonstrated small bowel enteritis (not shown)

The patient developed refractory septic and cardiogenic shock and required intubation and ventilation. Intubation was complicated by bronchial bleeding that required transfusion and endobronchial intervention. The patient had been temporarily commenced on therapeutic heparin for portal vein thrombosis; however, this was rapidly reversed with Prothrombinex®-VF (CSL Behring, Victoria, Australia) [7]. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (estimated LV ejection fraction, 21%) but no evidence of valvular dysfunction or infective endocarditis. Despite maximal intensive care support, including intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation, the patient died 2 days after admission to intensive care, 6 days after his initial presentation.

"A 42-year-old woman (BMI 29.1 kg/m²) who suffered from chronic migraine without aura and migraine with aura once every 1-2 months. She had a regular menstrual cycle and had been taking a progesterone-only contraceptive for 4-5 years.

With treatment using galcanezumab (120 mg per month) for migraine management, she was able to achieve a significant reduction in migraine attacks. However, about 1 or 2 weeks after starting the treatment, she experienced a loss of libido. Sexual arousal also completely disappeared, making it nearly impossible for her to achieve orgasm.

Since the patient was certain that the loss of libido was solely due to taking galcanezumab, she did not consult a psychologist or sex therapist.

Although she did not experience any further side effects from galcanezumab, she decided to switch to erenumab 140 mg monthly. However, erenumab appeared to be less effective, as the patient continued to experience daily headaches (triggered by physical exercise), while still not noticing any improvement in libido.","Diagnosis:

Galcanezumab-induced sexual dysfunction

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Low
* Rationale: The patient experienced a loss of libido and difficulty achieving orgasm shortly after starting galcanezumab treatment. The temporal relationship between the initiation of galcanezumab and the onset of sexual dysfunction suggests a causal link.

Suitable Treatments:
* Discontinue galcanezumab and consider alternative migraine prophylaxis options, such as topiramate, propranolol, or amitriptyline
* - If the patients sexual function improves after discontinuing galcanezumab, consider re-challenging with a lower dose or an alternative CGRP antagonist, such as erenumab or fremanezumab, while monitoring for sexual side effects"
"The second migraine patient was a 45-year-old woman (BMI 24.1 kg/m2), also suffering from chronic migraine without aura. She had a regular menstrual cycle and was not taking hormones.

She was also treated with galcanezumab (120 mg per month), which was able to significantly reduce the frequency of her migraines. Like the first patient, she reported a decrease in libido after starting the treatment. She also mentioned gaining four kilograms over nine months without changing her lifestyle.

After taking galcanezumab for nearly eleven months, she decided to discontinue the treatment, feeling that the relief from migraine symptoms was not worth the side effects of weight gain and decreased libido.

After stopping galcanezumab, she noticed an improvement in libido over the following two months. According to the authors, no significant changes were observed in the womans personal situation that could have affected her libido, apart from the initiation of galcanezumab treatment.

Neither woman experienced issues such as dyspareunia, vaginismus, anorgasmia, or a phobic aversion to physical-sexual contact, nor were there any symptoms of (peri)menopause. The authors interpreted the cases presented as ""sexual arousal disorder.""

According to the authors, the genesis of this condition is attributable to the peripheral consequences of CGRP blockade rather than central effects. In their view, a direct central effect of the antibodies was unlikely, as, due to their size, they would hardly be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in significant amounts.

The exact role of CGRP in sexual arousal has not yet been fully clarified, report Linda Al-Hassany and colleagues. However, immunohistochemical tests on human clitoral tissue have shown that the peptide is present, particularly in sensory C fibers and in co-localization with substance P. The peptide seems to be involved in clitoral physiology by exerting sensory and vasodilatory effects, similar to those exerted on the penis.

Furthermore, CGRP acts as a neurotransmitter in the vagina, where it regulates blood flow and capillary permeability. Consequently, blocking the effects of CGRP with antibodies could lead to a reduced genital response, including less vaginal lubrication.","Diagnosis:

Sexual Arousal Disorder

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The most likely diagnosis, given the temporal relationship between the initiation of galcanezumab treatment and the onset of symptoms (decreased libido and weight gain) and subsequent improvement after discontinuation.

Suitable Treatments:
* Discontinuation of galcanezumab"
"Ms H, a 21 year old woman, consulted with a one day history of sore throat. She did not complain of cough or of any other associated respiratory symptom. On examination she was feverish (38°C), with exudate on her tonsils and tender cervical lymph nodes. A textbook of diagnostic strategies suggests that this collection of symptoms and signs increases the likelihood of her having group A β haemolytic streptococcus infection to over 40%.1 She was treated with a seven day course of penicillin, and a throat swab was taken to confirm infection with group A β haemolytic streptococcus. Four days later the swab result confirmed the presence of group A β haemolytic streptococcus which was sensitive to penicillin. Nine days after the initial consultation Ms H returned complaining of continuing symptoms of sore throat and requesting further antibiotics. She still had inflamed tonsils but with no exudate; her cervical lymphadenopathy had persisted. In view of her positive throat swab she was given a further course of penicillin. Serology for infectious mononucleosis was negative. A subsequent consultation confirmed that her sore throat had settled two days after the second consultation.","Diagnosis:

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Moderate

Additionally, a throat swab confirmed the presence of Group A β-Haemolytic Streptococcus. Although symptoms persisted after initial penicillin treatment, this is still the most likely diagnosis.

"17 year old woman, consulted with a two day history of sore throat and blocked nose. Examination revealed an inflamed pharynx with some exudate, but the patient was otherwise well. She had been treated with two consecutive courses of antibiotics for a similar illness in 1997. She was keen to have antibiotics again. After some negotiation a compromise was reached: antibiotics were not prescribed, but a throat swab was taken. A week later the swab result confirmed group A haemolytic streptococcus (non-β) reported as sensitive to penicillin, and a letter with a prescription was sent to Ms D after contact by telephone failed. One week after this the patient complained to the practice manager that she still had a sore throat. Her sister had been seen the day before (by a different doctor) with the same symptoms and was prescribed antibiotics immediately. An appointment to see the doctor concerned to discuss the complaint was made, but the patient failed to attend.
Questions
The throat swab is currently recommended as a diagnostic aid in patients with sore throat.3The quoted sensitivity (26-30%) and specificity (73-80%), however, are low when compared with the “gold standard” of a rise in antistreptolysin O titre.6 The antistreptolysin O titre is probably the best predictor for the presence of group A β haemolytic streptococcus, the most common bacterial pathogen causing sore throat, as the association with definite cases of rheumatic fever and high initial level of antistreptolysin O titre or rise in antistreptolysin O titre is 100%.7 The low predictive value of throat swabs is probably due to a high symptomless carriage rate of group A β haemolytic streptococcus (ranging from 6% to 40%).7 Although antistreptolysin O titre may be a better gold standard, it is not suitable for routine use because of delay, cost, and the inconvenience of serial titres. As the first case illustrates, if the throat culture is positive it is difficult not to prescribe further antibiotics.","Diagnosis:

Group A β-Haemolytic Streptococcus Infection

* Probability: Unknown
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The patients profile fits with classic symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis including sore throat, fever (38°C), exudate on tonsils, and tender cervical lymph nodes. Additionally, a throat swab confirmed the presence of Group A β-Haemolytic Streptococcus. Although symptoms persisted after initial penicillin treatment, this is still the most likely diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Antibiotics: Penicillin or Amoxicillin, considering the pathogens sensitivity
* Alternatively, a macrolide like Azithromycin could be used if the patient is allergic to penicillin
* - Symptomatic Care: Analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain and fever, throat lozenges, and plenty of fluids"
"34-year-old woman presented to the emergency department for evaluation of a 12-hour history of sudden severe epigastric pain and bilateral leg weakness during exercise associated with nausea and vomiting. She experienced 2 episodes of diarrhea; 1 of which was blood streaked. The patient reported not eating or drinking much that day. She described a few previous less severe episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea since childhood associated with certain foods. She denied fever or chills but reported a 5-lb intentional weight loss during the past month. She denied changes in her appetite, myalgia, arthralgia, or vision changes. She had no recent travel, sick contacts, or antibiotic drug use. She denied current pregnancy.

The patient was previously healthy; her medical history included recurrent urinary tract infections and infertility, with a previous artificial insemination attempt resulting in a missed abortion. Current medication use includes clomiphene and progesterone vaginal suppository.

At presentation, her vital signs were as follows: temperature, 36.9°C; heart rate, 69 beats/min; respiratory rate, 16 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 98/60 mm Hg. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but was in no acute distress. Her abdomen was soft and nondistended, with positive bowel sounds. She had generalized tenderness in all 4 quadrants, with absence of guarding and rebound tenderness. Her mucous membranes appeared dry. Lower extremity strength was normal. Results of a urine pregnancy test obtained on arrival to the emergency department were negative.

The clinical presentation and CT findings suggest colitis. The differential diagnosis for the cause of colitis includes infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic etiologies. Imaging studies are nonspecific and do not differentiate between these etiologies of colitis.
A serum lactate level could refer to either a serum l-lactate or a serum d-lactate level. An elevated serum l-lactate level would indicate either tissue hypoxia (type A lactic acidosis) or decreased clearance of lactic acid, which occurs most commonly with liver disease (type B lactic acidosis). d-Lactate is produced by bacteria in the gut and is metabolized slowly by humans. Patients with short-bowel syndrome can develop lactic acidosis from elevated serum levels of d-lactate. An elevated serum lactate level would not confirm the diagnosis of colitis or clarify the underlying etiology.

Endoscopy is the preferred method for confirming the diagnosis and cause of colitis. In this patient, flexible sigmoidoscopy would not allow visualization of the affected areas of bowel; therefore, colonoscopy is the best test to confirm the diagnosis.
Mesenteric angiography would not be the next step in the evaluation of colitis. It may play a role in the evaluation of ischemic colitis if there is isolated right-sided colonic involvement (possible superior mesenteric artery occlusion) or if there is a question as to whether a patient has mesenteric ischemia or colonic ischemia.

A colonoscopy was performed next and showed areas of irregular erosion and ulceration starting at the splenic flexure and involving the distal colon. The mucosa in the distal ileum, as well as the cecum; ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon; and rectum, appeared normal. A biopsy of the area of segmental colitis showed edema and hemorrhage in the lamina propria and superficial epithelial necrosis.

In patients with findings of colitis on CT, stool antimicrobial assessment (including Clostridium difficile toxin testing) to assess for infectious colitis is often completed before proceeding with colonoscopy. In this case, stool antimicrobial assessment was initiated but not completed before colonoscopy. The patients ongoing abdominal pain and the distribution of colonic lesions on CT, which raised concern for skip lesions of Crohn disease, led to the pursuit of early colonoscopy. Stool assessment ultimately revealed few fecal leukocytes and a negative polymerase chain reaction result for Shiga toxin. The stool cultures for enteric pathogens were negative for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Aeromonas.

In ulcerative colitis, one would expect to see mucosal disease (erythema, edema, hemorrhage, or ulceration) starting at the rectum and extending proximally. Biopsy findings would include diffuse crypt architectural irregularity and reduced crypt numbers.5,6 The rectal mucosa was not involved in this case, making ulcerative colitis unlikely. Crohn disease could account for the colonic and distal ileal involvement seen on CT; however, on a colonoscopy one would expect to see a cobblestone pattern of ulcerations enclosing islands of normal mucosa.5 Biopsy findings would include granulomas and focal or patchy inflammation.6

Transient ischemic colitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The scattered erosions and ulcerations seen on the colonoscopy, combined with the biopsy findings of superficial mucosal edema, hemorrhage, and epithelial necrosis, are classic.7 Other findings on the colonoscopy in ischemic colitis include edematous and fragile mucosa, scattered erythema, purple hemorrhagic nodules, and sharp demarcation of the area of involved bowel. In severe forms of ischemic colitis, the mucosa appears cyanotic, and pseudomembranes, pseudopolyps, and pseudotumors may be seen. In gangrenous ischemic colitis, bluish-black mucosal nodules may be present.8

The clinical suspicion for infectious colitis was low in this case because the patient had no recent travel or dietary history to suggest exposure to enteric pathogens. Furthermore, results of stool studies were negative. The patient was treated supportively for a diagnosis of transient ischemic colitis based on her colonoscopy and clinical presentation. Her abdominal pain resolved, and she continued to remain free of recurrence of diarrhea or GI bleeding. She did not experience any recurrent lower extremity weakness with ambulation.

The right colon is infrequently involved in ischemic colitis. It most commonly involves watershed areas of the bowel, such as the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction.8In one series, the splenic flexure was involved in 57% of patients, and the sigmoid and rectum were involved in 9%.9 Involvement of the left colon (80%) is much more common than that of the right colon (4.7%).8

The most common presenting symptoms of ischemic colitis include abdominal pain (49%-78%), GI bleeding (62%-77%), and diarrhea (33%-38%).8,9 Age is a risk factor for ischemic colitis, with elderly patients being at a higher risk than young, healthy patients. In addition, females are at higher risk for ischemic colitis than are males. Other risk factors include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, constipation, and the use of predisposing medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, antihypertensives, laxatives, oral contraceptives, and anticonvulsants).1,2,8-10 Hypotension and hypovolemia, not cardiac thromboembolism, are the most common mechanisms by which ischemic colitis occurs.2

This patients clinical presentation with abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and diarrhea is consistent with a typical case of ischemic colitis. Her young age, lack of comorbid disease, and absence of predisposing medication use, however, make her case atypical. She was at risk for hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake and exercise when her symptoms developed, and she was hypotensive at presentation. Her hypotension and hypovolemia were treated by intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline on hospital admission. The hypotension responded to fluid rehydration, with no further recurrence during hospitalization.

Most cases of ischemic colitis are of a mild form (transient ischemic colitis) that resolves with supportive measures, including intravenous hydration, hemodynamic stabilization, discontinuation of offending medications, bowel rest, and antibiotic drug therapy.2,4 It can be difficult on initial presentation to distinguish mild forms of ischemic colitis from severe forms that may require surgical intervention. One risk factor for more severe disease associated with worse outcomes is right-sided colonic involvement.11

Eighteen percent of patients develop chronic ischemic colitis.11 They may experience diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, or GI bleeding, and their disease may progress to stricture formation or gangrene.4 Malnutrition from protein-losing enteropathy and symptomatic stricture are indications for surgical intervention in patients with chronic ischemic colitis.2

The role of hypercoagulable states in the pathogenesis of ischemic colitis is unclear. There is no evidence that diagnosing and treating a hypercoagulable state in a patient with an initial episode of colonic ischemia is beneficial.

This young woman was treated conservatively with intravenous fluids and morphine. She was counseled regarding the importance of maintaining adequate hydration before, during, and after exercise. She was discharged from the hospital and did not report recurrence of abdominal pain or bloody diarrhea during 1-year follow-up.","Diagnosis:

Transient Ischemic Colitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate to High
* Rationale: The patient’s symptoms of sudden severe epigastric pain, GI bleeding, and diarrhea, combined with colonoscopy findings of scattered erosions and ulcerations, and biopsy results showing epithelial necrosis and edema, strongly indicate transient ischemic colitis. The lack of comorbid disease and predisposing medication use, her hypotension, poor oral intake, and exercise likely predisposed her to ischemic colitis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Intravenous hydration, bowel rest, hemodynamic stabilization, and discontinuation of any potential offending medications
* - Analgesia: Morphine for pain management
* - Patient Education: Importance of maintaining hydration, especially before and after exercise
* - Follow-up: Routine follow-up to monitor for recurrence and ensure symptom resolution"
"A 51-year-old Chinese woman, who had a past medical history of end stage renal failure, parathyroidectomy, hemithyroidectomy, was admitted in June 2015 for acute abdomen and shock. Upon initial assessment, she was found to have tachycardia, borderline blood pressure, confusion and abdominal peritoneal signs.

Her white cell count was 16.1 × 103/uL (neutrophils 85.1%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 16 mm/h. The results of chemistry studies included a total bilirubin of 1.67 mg/dL with direct bilirubin 0.62 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 610 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase of 193 IU/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase of 275 IU/L. At presentation, her clotting profile was normal.

Emergency ultrasound revealed a gallbladder filled with hyperechoic substances. Gallbladder wall was thickened with hypervascularity. Sonographic Murphys sign was positive. Low-level internal echoes were present within the ascitic fluid in the pelvis and the Morrisons pouch (Fig. 1).

Fig 1
Fig. 1. Grayscale ultrasound (left) and power doppler ultrasound (right). Echogenic substances represent hemobilia (asterisk).

Immediate contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed. It confirmed hemoperitoneum and distended gallbladder filled with blood and perforation at its fundus. Active contrast extravasation was noted at its wall. Hypodense filling defects inside the gallbladder may represent polypoid growth. Overall finding could be due to acalculous cholecystitis or underlying gallbladder tumor with hemorrhage.

Patient was arranged for emergency embolization. With retrograde right femoral approach, SMA angiogram showed a replaced right hepatic artery from superior mesenteric artery, with active contrast extravasation from the cystic artery of the gallbladder. Celiac angiogram showed no supply to bleeders. Superselective catheterization of the cystic artery was achieved, followed by embolization using particles and coils to the main supplying branch and main cystic artery (Fig. 3).

In order to tide over the acute episode, our interventional radiologist offered percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy to the patient, using a 7Fr single-step drainage catheter with ultrasound guidance. Blood clot was removed by manual aspiration. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparotomy and cholecystostomy on the following day. Pathology report of the specimen confirmed acute on chronic inflammation with hemorrhagic necrosis and incidental note of gallbladder polyps.

Post procedural digital subtraction angiography demonstrates multiple microcoils (arrowhead) within the proximal cystic artery, with complete occlusion of the artery and nonopacification of the distal part.
After hemodynamic stabilization, for patients who are not surgical candidates, a cholecystostomy is an option. There was a report of hemorrhagic cholecystitis treated with a cholecystostomy and urokinase therapy [11]. Urgent percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy was undertaken in our case using a 7 Fr single-step drainage catheter with ultrasound guidance and blood clots were aspirated. It was followed by cholecystectomyon the ensuing day. In summary, hemorrhagic cholecystitis is rare but its fatal complications are not rare. The condition warrants a high index of suspicion.","Diagnosis:

Hemorrhagic acalculous cholecystitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with acute abdomen, shock, and imaging findings of a distended gallbladder filled with blood, perforation, and active contrast extravasation. Acalculous cholecystitis is a possible cause of hemorrhagic cholecystitis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Emergency embolization of the cystic artery
* Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy with blood clot removal
* Laparotomy and cholecystectomy"
"51-year-old man was transferred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, complaining of watery diarrhea and bloody stools for the past 12 hours and abdominal pain along with shortness of breath for the past 4 hours. Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient consumed large quantities of suspected contaminated food. Twelve hours before admission, the patient began to develop watery diarrhea alternating with bloody stools, with a total volume of about 500 mL, accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. Eight hours later, the patient developed abdominal pain, accompanied by shortness of breath, pallor and sweating with no complaints of fever and chills.

The patient had a previous medical history of hypertension and gout over ten years but was poorly compliant to medical treatment. His surgical history was nonsignificant. He had a twenty pack-year history of drinking and denied any other specific personal or family history of other diseases.

Physical examination upon admission revealed a temperature of 36 °C, tachycardia at 102 bpm, tachypnea at 40 breaths per minute and hypotensive shock with blood pressure at 59/38 mmHg. The patient was somnolent and poorly responsive. Both lungs were covered with rales and phlegm sounds on auscultation. The abdomen was distended and slight tensed, tenderness and rebound tenderness were not elicited due to comatose state of the patient. No other pathological signs were noted.

Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (17.72×10E9cells/L) with predominantly neutrophils (94%), mild anemia (94 g/L) and a normal platelet count (173×10E9 cells/L). Liver and renal function tests showed elevated transaminases (ALT 1,999 U/L and AST 3,099 U/L), serum creatinine (213 µmol/L), serum uric acid (503 µmol/L), serum potassium (6.65 mmol/L) and a decreased albumin (26.9 g/L). Serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were increased at 554 mg/L and greater than 100 ng/mL respectively. Arterial-blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed acidosis (pH 7.2), normocapnia (pCO2 32.8 mmHg) and hypoxemia (pO229.9mmHg) with hyperlactemia (lactate concentration 13.5 mmol/L). On admission, a Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral pneumonia with consolidation in the upper lobe of the right lung (Figure 1A). The abdominal CT scan revealed diffuse peritonitis and marked edema with thickening of the small intestinal walls (Figure 1B,C).


Figure 1 Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the patient. (A) Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pneumonia with consolidation in upper lobe of the right lung and air bronchogram sign; (B) contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan showed diffuse peritonitis and marked edema of the small intestine with significant enhancement of the intestinal wall; (C) coronal reconstruction of abdominal CT showed thickening and edema of the intestine; (D) bedside chest radiography showed significant improvement of the upper lobe of the right lung.
The patient who presented with respiratory failure, hyperkalemia and septic shock, was immediately started on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, aggressive fluid resuscitation with vasopressors dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and drotaverine to relieve gastrointestinal cramps. Initial diagnosis of severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and acute severe gastroenteritis was based on the clinical findings including patient history, symptoms and work-up findings. Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with meropenem 2 g TID, tigecycline 100 mg BID and moxifloxacin 0.4 g QD was administered. Hydrocortisone 0.1 g TID was injected to reduce the inflammatory response. In addition, high-dose gamma globulin was given to boost immunity along with human serum albumin, hepatoprotective treatment and nutrition support. On October 24, 2018, we initiated ventilator weaning protocols when inflammatory indices and ABG values of the patient significantly improved and bedside chest X-rays showed significant improvement (Figure 1D). On October 24, 2018 diarrhea recurred with a daily volume of 500–1,000 mL. Sputum and blood cultures were negative, but urine and stool cultures were positive for Candida albicans. Intravenous antifungal therapy with caspofungin 500 mg QD was administered. On October 27, 2018, gastrointestinal hemorrhage recurred as hematochezia and hematemesis, with a total volume of 2,000 mL. After failure of conservative treatment, a laparotomy was finally performed revealing multisegmental bowel necrosis from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum with severe congestion and dark purple appearance and multiple mesenteric ulcer and abscesses, rupture of the small intestine 70 cm proximal to the ileocecum. The necrotic bowel was then resected (Figure 2). Histopathological examination of the resected bowel showed extensive inflammation and necrosis of the mucosa, partial intestinal wall full-thickness necrosis, subserosal hemorrhage and fibrinoid vascular necrosis accompanied by endovascular thrombosis, with large-scale local infiltration of neutrophils, suggestive of AHNE (Figure 3). The final diagnosis of the presented case was AHNE. On November 2, 2018, the patient developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding (about 3,000 mL), prompting a second emergency laparotomy for hemostasis. The patient postoperatively developed necrosis at the incision site which complicated with infection (Figure 2D). He unfortunately died of the disease on December 3, 2018 following repeated bouts of hemorrhage and infection despite active medical treatment and multiple surgical interventions (for details of the course, see Figure 4). All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013). The patient and his legal guardian provided informed written consent for publication of this study and any accompanying images during the treatment.


Figure 2 Operative picture of the patient. (A) Laparotomy revealed multisegmental bowel necrosis from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum with severe congestion, edema and dark purple appearance; rupture of the small intestine 70 cm proximal to the ileocecum was visible (see the arrow); (B) multiple mesenteric ulcer and abscesses were visible (see the arrow); (C) the lesions were segmentally distributed and involved the serosa; transmural necrosis and hemorrhage were visible; (D) post-operative incision site necrosis complicated with infection.","Diagnosis:

Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Enterocolitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Highest
* Rationale: The symptoms of watery diarrhea alternating with bloody stools, abdominal pain, and the CT findings of diffuse peritonitis, edema, and thickening of the small intestinal walls along with multisegmental bowel necrosis seen during laparotomy are highly indicative of AHNE. The final histopathological examination confirmed this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Immediate surgical intervention for resection of necrotic bowel, aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, tigecycline, and moxifloxacin as started), intravenous antifungal therapy (caspofungin), mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, gamma globulin, and supportive care for multisystem organ dysfunction"
"43-year-old nonsmoking female with a past medical history of MFS, MVP, and a 4.0 cm dilated ascending aorta who presented to her cardiologist after being diagnosed with an abdominal aortic dissection by her OB-GYN. The patient noted that since a C-section 2 years prior, the left side of her abdomen protruded more when standing compared to the right. She denied associated abdominal, chest, or back pain. The patient was told that she may have a hernia in the past.

Because she was concerned about the asymmetry of her abdomen, she went to a new OB-GYN who ordered an abdominal CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast which showed a 5.5 cm abdominal aortic dissection. The patient was reluctant to go to the hospital until she saw her cardiologist a few days later, who recommended hospitalization and a consult for cardiothoracic surgery.

Interestingly, when the patient was seen in the hospital, she again denied chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. She only mentioned that her left side of the abdomen protrudes more than the right side when standing. On physical exam, patient had several features typical to MFS: she was tall, had a high arched palate, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum, and her arm span was greater than her height. Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, had normal bowel sounds, and no pulsatile mass was appreciated. However, when the patient stood up, it was clear that the left side of her abdomen was bulging out in comparison to the right. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a dissecting aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to 5.6 cm (Figure 1); the false lumen supplied the left common iliac artery and the true lumen supplied the right common iliac artery. There was no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.

Figure 1
CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast demonstrating dissection of the abdominal aorta.

The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on a nitroglycerin drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and recommended the patient to undergo open surgical repair of the abdominal aortic dissection. In order to risk stratify the patient prior to the procedure, the patient underwent a regadenoson nuclear medicine stress test, which was low risk for ischemia. The patient underwent successful repair of her abdominal aortic dissection via a minimally invasive open retroperitoneal approach. She tolerated the procedure well without postoperative complications.

The patient came into the hospital with no home medications. As she has reported in the past, she was tried on nebivolol but had failed it due to syncope. Given this, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID was started cautiously to provide long-term benefits for the patients abdominal and thoracic aorta. The patient tolerated this medication well and was safely discharged home with close cardiovascular follow-up.","Diagnosis:

Abdominal Aortic Dissection

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The CT scan confirmed the presence of a dissecting aneurysm in the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring 5.6 cm. The diagnosis was initially made by her OB-GYN and confirmed upon repeat imaging. Although the patient lacks typical dissection symptoms such as pain, her Marfan Syndrome (MFS) significantly increases the risk for aortic dissection.

Suitable Treatments:
* adequate supportive care, pain control, and respiratory support as needed, and immunotherapy"
"53-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension who was taking no medications was in his usual state of health 3 days ago before developing a sudden onset of right lower quadrant pain. The pain was described as continuous, sharp, 8/10 in intensity, radiating down to the right leg, aggravating with any body movement and decreasing with rest. Pain was also once associated with non-bloody vomiting. The patient went to see his primary care physician who referred him to the hospital for evaluation of possible appendicitis. Initially, appendicitis was suspected since the patient had severe right lower quadrant pain, rebound tenderness, episodes of anorexia, nausea/vomiting and leucocytosis. Before admission to the hospital, the patient was taking Motrin with minimal relief for the last 3 days. On arrival, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. He had a blood pressure (BP) of 241/151 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate was 18/min, blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) of 97% on room air, temperature 37.4 °C.
On examination, abdomen was soft, with moderate right lower quadrant tenderness. Voluntary guarding, mild rebound and Rovsing’s sign were positive. His right leg showed weakly palpable pulse in popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedic artery.

Laboratory results displayed elevated white cell count (WCC) 21.2x109/L with 79 neutrophils. Thus, he received 20 mg intravenous labetalol which improved his BP to 178/100 mm Hg. His ECG was normal. A chest X-ray was done to rule out right lower lobe pneumonia, perforation and a search for free air below the diaphragm. The chest X-ray showed prominent aortic arch without cardiomegaly. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to rule out appendicitis which showed AD in descending aorta without rupture. When the AD was seen, thoracic CT scan was added with additional 25 cc of contrast which displayed sparing of ascending and arch of aorta (figure 1).

There is no evidence of involvement of the great vessels of the aortic arch. (B–D) show CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Aortic dissection is noted extending from the thoracic aorta, through the abdominal aorta into the bilateral external iliac arteries. Arrows pointing to dissection flap at the edge of the aorta.

The patient’s BP increased again to 184/101 mm Hg, and thus esmolol drip was initiated, and he was admitted to the intensive care unit for closer haemodynamic monitoring. His BP remained elevated, so nicardipine drip was also started. The therapeutic goal of BP was to remain below 120/80 mm Hg. Medical management was recommended for the patient.

Meanwhile, secondary causes of hypertension were also investigated, and the work-up for thyroid-stimulating hormone, plasma renin, aldosterone, metanephrine, cortisol, toxicology were normal. An ultrasound Doppler of the kidney displayed mild renal artery stenosis. Creatinine was normal, and echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction, grade II diastolic dysfunction and moderate aortic regurgitation.

Based on patient’s history and physicals including onset and location of pain and elevated WCC, differential diagnosis was broadened to include acute appendicitis, acute ureteric colic/urinary tract infection, severe gastroenteritis, small bowel obstruction, terminal ileitis, malignancy, incarcerated or strangulated femoral hernia, and psoas abscess. The diagnosis was made by a combination of clinical suspicion, vitals and CT scan.","Diagnosis:

Aortic Dissection

* Probability: High (Confirmed by CT scan)
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The patient presents with severe hypertension, sudden onset of pain radiating to the leg, and imaging revealing aortic dissection.

Suitable Treatments:
* remove appendicitis"
"By A 55-year-old female patient was admitted to a peripheral hospital and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis due to salmonella. Her stay was complicated by bacterial meningitis based on clinical symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9, and positive meningismus signs. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further management where the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was confirmed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis from a lumbar puncture (LP) that showed (WBC) 35,811/mic liter; neutrophils 85 %; protein 383 mg/dl; glucose 103 mg/dl. CSF PCR revealed Streptococcus pneumonia. Unenhanced CT-brain showed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where she was intubated and started on cefepime 2 g IV Q8h, vancomycin 1 g IV Q12h and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV 12 hourly. On day 3, the patient had two episodes of high-grade fever of 39.4 °C with generalized seizures and deterioration in mental status so there was an escalation in antibiotics and was put on valproic acid 1 g IV 12 hourly. The patient improved clinically in the next few days and was extubated in the ICU. Blood cultures showed no bacterial growth with mildly elevated CRP and WBC on blood analysis.

On day 9, the patient started complaining of dizziness and headache. On day 14, the patient suddenly developed generalized weakness. Neurological examination showed left proportional hemiplegia. MRI brain showed an area of restricted diffusion with no corresponding enhancement in the right pons which may denote a sub-acute ischemic lesion (Fig. 1).


Fig. 1. Diffusion-weighted sequence shows an area of restricted diffusion in the right pons, as evidenced by the high signal intensity of the lesion. (Black arrow).

Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) revealed no evidence of endocarditis; hence, septic emboli were ruled out as a possible cause of the ischemic stroke. On day 16, CT brain without contrast was compared to the previous MRI examination and showed an area of hypodensity in the pons confirming a subacute ischemic stroke (Fig. 2). The patient was still febrile (38.1 °C). A second lumbar puncture (LP) showed clear CSF: CSF white blood cells (WBC) 437/ mic liter; neutrophils 60 %; CSF protein 149 mg/dl; CSF glucose 55 mg/dl. CSF PCR was negative for streptococcus pneumonia. Screening for other infections was negative. On day 18, no improvement was noted and the patient’s level of consciousness was decreasing with a GCS score of 4, generalized seizures and recurrent episodes of high-grade fever for which the patient was reintubated. EEG was negative for sub-clinical seizures. Blood cultures were negative for nocardia. HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody enzyme immunoassay screening was negative. CSF Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) smear was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CSF PCR was also negative for tuberculosis and other possible infectious agents. In the ICU, the patient’s symptoms have totally resolved after administration of dexamethasone 8 mg IV Q8h for 3 days. For this reason, a non-infectious inflammatory process was suspected. Immunology testing was positive for Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA) and cryoglobulins and negative for P-ANCA and C-ANCA. A second MRI brain revealed new restricted diffusion areas in both thalami more prominent on the left side denoting acute ischemic lesions (Fig. 3). Another TEE showed no vegetations, hence, absence of any source of septic emboli. Atrial fibrillationwas also ruled out as another source of septic emboli by using a cardiac Holter monitor. On day 25, the patient had no more episodes of fever. She improved over the coming days and was discharged home with a GCS of 14. The patient was put on oral Prednisone 20 mg 12 hourly for one week followed by a dosage of 10 mg TID for an additional week. The patient also was prescribed Vancomycin 1 g IV Q12h and Cefepime 2 g IV Q8h for one week. The patient exhibited upon discharge sustained consciousness, articulate verbal communication, and the capacity for autonomous meal intake. Motor evaluation demonstrated significant improvement with mild weakness on the left side. Notably, the patient was discharged utilizing a wheelchair as the primary means of mobility. A structured rehabilitation plan, featuring daily physiotherapy sessions, was promptly implemented to address ambulatory limitations. The rehabilitation regimen concentrates on gait training, balance refinement, and muscular strength development. MRI brain 1 month after discharge showed features of normal ischemic changes translated by reduced sequence abnormality on FLAIR and DW (Fig. 4). Following four months of rehabilitation, left sided weakness has totally resolved.

"An 85-year-old man with a history of Parkinson’s disease was referred for a history of recurrent syncope, which had resulted in extensive cardiac investigation. Collateral history revealed that the events were orthostatic in nature, but with variable time to onset of symptoms. The patient was found to have significant postural drop in blood pressure without compensatory tachycardia. Cardiovascular autonomic function testing was performed, which confirmed significant autonomic nervous system failure, including a marked hypotensive response on tilt-table testing and a lack of vasoconstriction during Valsalva manoeuvre. The patient was diagnosed with nOH and initiated on midodrine with subjective improvement in the frequency of syncope.
The patient’s past medical history included a history of PD Parkinson’s Disease with cognitive impairment and labile hypertension. He had no prior history of coronary artery disease or cardiac arrhythmias. His only medication was levodopa/carbidopa.

Previous attempts at characterizing the patient’s syncope had been limited by his cognitive impairment. However, a second history was taken in conjunction with the patient’s family. Based on the family’s recollection, the patient’s syncope would only occur while standing. However, the timing between standing and his events were variable, often occurring after several minutes of standing. The presence of symptoms prior to events were unclear, but the family reported they could often tell before he was about to faint based on his appearance. The syncopal events were brief, typically lasting several seconds with rapid return of consciousness. The syncopal events were gradually increasing in frequency, and now occurred several times per day. Previous investigations, including a 24-h Holter monitor and echocardiogram, were unremarkable.

Given this history, there was a high clinical suspicion for nOH. Orthostatic vital signs were assessed, revealing a supine blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 b.p.m. After standing for 5 min, the patient’s heart rate was still 70 b.p.m., but the blood pressure dropped to 90/50 mmHg. Although the patient did not report any symptoms, family members reported that the patient ‘looked like he was about to faint’. Cardiovascular autonomic function testing was performed, which confirmed significant autonomic nervous system failure, including a marked hypotensive response on tilt-table testing and a lack of vasoconstriction during Valsalva manoeuvre, which are shown in Figures 1 and ​22. Overall, the clinical presentation was characteristic of nOH [blood pressure drop of >20/10 mmHg (or >30/15 mmHg with baseline supine hypertension) with only a minimal or absent increase in heart rate].

Tilt-table results. (A) Normal. (B) Patient’s response. The patient had supine hypertension with an initial systolic blood pressure of 190 mmHg. Following the head-up-tilt to 80°, there was progressive hypotension without significant heart rate response. The patient’s haemodynamics recovered shortly after reversing the tilt.


Figure 2
Valsalva results. (A) Normal. (B) Patient’s response. During the strain phase of the Valsalva manoeuvre, there were significant drops in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with no significant change in heart rate

Although levodopa may be contributing to the patient’s hypotension, it was required to manage his PD. Therefore, the patient was given a prescription for midodrine 5 mg PO q4H ×3 (with nominal dosing times of 8 a.m., noon, and 4 p.m.). The patient’s family was directed to give midodrine prior to the patient’s typical active periods to avoid exacerbating his supine hypertension. Additionally, the family was advised that they should help the patient to a supine position when he appeared similar to the event which was reproduced in clinic. This resulted in a subjective decrease in the frequency of syncope during follow-up.","Diagnosis:

Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The clinical presentation is highly characteristic of nOH, supported by orthostatic vital signs revealing a significant drop in blood pressure without compensatory tachycardia, confirmed by tilt-table testing and the Valsalva maneuver. Additionally, the patient’s history of Parkinson’s disease and autonomic failure further support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Correcting aggravating factors
Lifestyle changes
Medication
Stopping medications that can reduce blood pressure, such as diuretics, anti-hypertensives, some medications used for prostate and urinary symptoms, medications for erectile dysfunction, medications for angina and some antidepressants is a first step
* Levodopa (Sinemet®) can lower blood pressure, and adjusting dosage may be necessary in people with Parkinson’s and nOH
* Anemia (a condition where you have low levels of hemoglobin, iron, in your blood) can aggravate nOH and should be investigated and treated accordingly
* Symptoms of nOH can improve with time, patience and non-pharmacological changes
* It is tempting to try to control nOH only with medications; however, this approach is less effective and may have adverse side effects
* Treatment of nOH is more successful if lifestyle changes are also made
* Below are lifestyle steps you can take to improve symptoms of nOH
* You can adopt all of them at the same time
* If performed properly, these actions can lead to a dramatic improvement, even without medications"
"A 35-year-old Asian male presented to the hospital with a syncopal episode while he was walking home from a restaurant. He had two glasses of wine that evening but had been feeling dizzy and lightheaded in recent weeks. He did not have any significant past medical history and was not on any regular medication. He denied any palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath. He could not recall the syncopal episode fully and was found at the roadside by bystanders. On arrival at the hospital, his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with right axis deviation (RAD) and right bundle branch block (RBBB) (Figure 1).

He had sustained facial and hand injuries. Most blood tests including troponin T, creatinine kinase, HbA1c, immune screening tests such as complement levels, rheumatoid factor, proteinase 3 antibody, myeloperoxidase antibody, myocardial antibody, and cardiolipin antibody, thyroid function tests, creatinine kinase were within normal limits. Viral screening for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and COVID-19 was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 14 mm/hour (Normal range: 1-10 mm/hr). Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head and face showed a small fracture to the superior maxillary wall with overlying soft tissue swelling without any intracranial pathology. CT pulmonary angiogram showed florid centrilobular nodular opacification affecting the right upper and middle lobes, hilar lymphadenopathy, and anterior abdominal lymphadenopathy suggestive of possible tuberculosis (Figure ​(Figure2).2). Following further investigation and respiratory input, it was felt tuberculosis was highly unlikely. He was commenced on bisoprolol 2.5 mg once daily.

The patient was offered an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention. The patient was discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) for subcutaneous versus transvenous ICD and had subcutaneous ICD screening which was normal. A transvenous ICD was implanted following a multidisciplinary team meeting. Chest radiography post-ICD implantation showed satisfactory leads positioning (Figure ​(Figure5).5). Post-implantation device checks were satisfactory, and the patient was discharged home on bisoprolol 2.5 mg once daily with outpatient cardiology follow-up in the device clinic.

"A 66-year-old male patient was brought in by ambulance to the accident and emergency department owing to reported profuse per-rectum (PR) haemorrhage. He was a nursing home resident with a medical history of advanced Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia, with very limited communication and mobility. He was being artificially fed via a percutaneous gastrostomy tube. A history of chronic constipation was given by the nursing home staff who also reported a blood loss of approximately 1 l.

The patient presented with haemodynamic shock. On inspection, he was cachectic, very pale and drowsy. On examination, the Glasgow Coma Scale score was 11/15. He had cold extremities, with significant hypotension, tachycardia and tachypnoea. The initial recorded blood pressure (BP) was 67/46 mmHg, the pulse rate 94 beats min–1 and the respiratory rate 26 min–1. Laboratory blood tests revealed a haemoglobin concentration of 90 g l−1 and a platelet count of 153 × 109l–1 with deranged renal function: serum creatinine of 177 mol l–1 and urea of 41.6 mmol l–1. There were no previous results available for comparison.

Initial resuscitation measures were implemented, including immediate transfusion of 1 unit of O negative packed red cells. Clinical examination confirmed ongoing PR bleeding and a large, hard central abdominal mass.

The PR discharge consisted mostly of fresh red blood rather than melaena, suggesting a lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Given the palpable abdominal mass, a large colonic tumour was suspected, while other possible aetiologies such as diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, arteriovenous malformations or benign anorectal diseases (e.g. haemorrhoids) were believed to be less likely. However, given the amount of blood loss, the possibility of a fistula between the colon and an abdominal aortic aneurysm was raised. Following discussion with the on-call gastroenterology team, an urgent CT angiogram was requested.
An urgent abdominal CT was performed using a triple-phase scan consisting of unenhanced arterial and portal venous phases. The unenhanced scan demonstrated a conglomerate of stercoral stones forming a large intraluminal rectal mass that measured approximately 12 × 12 × 25 cm (transverse and craniocaudal diameters) and occupied most of the abdominopelvic cavity (Figure 1). Significant mass effect was noted with compression of the urinary bladder, leading to moderate bilateral ureterohydronephrosis and stretching of the surrounding vasculature. The contrast-enhanced scans demonstrated accumulation of intraluminal contrast, visible in both arterial and portal venous phases but most prominent on the former, in keeping with active arterial haemorrhage from what seemed to be a branch of the left internal iliac artery (Figure 2).

Axial CT images showing the large rectal faecaloma and intraluminal high-density material (arrows) consistent with contrast extravasation seen in the early arterial phase (a) and to a lesser extent on the delayed venous phase (b).

Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, repeated blood transfusions and administration of intravenous fresh frozen plasma and tranexamic acid, the PR haemorrhage persisted and the patient remained haemodynamically unstable with a recorded BP of 47/27 mmHg. The anaesthesia team was involved for inotropic support and general anaesthesia. Following discussion with the interventional radiologists, the patient was transferred to the angiography suite for embolization.

Vascular access was via an ultrasound-guided retrograde puncture in the right common femoral artery. An initial run of the left iliac system showed gross active extravasation from a branch of the internal iliac artery into the rectum, above the anal canal (Figure 3). The feeding vessel was selectively catheterized and embolized with 2- and 3-mm coils (Figure 4). Following this, angiography of the left inferior mesenteric artery and right internal iliac artery showed no evidence of extravasation from these vessels. Once control of the haemorrhage was achieved, there was rapid haemodynamic improvement with systolic BP values of 120–130 mmHg, compared with the pre-procedural values of 47–90 mmHg.

The patient spent 4 days on the intensive therapy unit where he made a good recovery without major complications. PR discharge of small and decreasing amounts of fresh blood continued for the first 12 h following embolization but no further episodes of bleeding were noted after this time. In total, the patient was transfused 18 units of packed red cells. He was started on a regimen of laxatives and had numerous frequent bowel movements over the course of his admission. He was discharged from hospital 1 week after admission with no routine follow-up. He presented 12 months later at a different hospital with unrelated symptoms.","Diagnosis:



* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The CT scan revealed a large rectal faecaloma causing significant mass effect and compression, which likely led to stercoral ulceration, contributing to lower GI bleeding. Active haemorrhage from the left internal iliac artery branch supports this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* conservatively with bowel rest, laxative, enema and digital evacuation"
"An 80 year old White female presented to the emergency department due to a syncopal episode following a two day history of nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake. The patient also reported a two week history of urinary retention for which she had sought care at an outside hospital prior to this admission. She was found to have lymphocytosis, hypovolemic hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. Her physical exam was remarkable for dry oral mucosa. A CT abdomen pelvis showed a large stool burden throughout the colon, dilatation of the rectum and perirectal edema. The patient was treated with an enema that resulted in small bowel movements. On day two of hospitalization, the patient became hypotensive. A normal saline bolus was given and she had an episode of fecal emesis. She was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure from aspiration, and transferred to the ICU. Repeat imaging and labs showed worsening conditions. The patient’s family decided to withdraw care on day three of hospitalization and she unfortunately succumbed to her illness.
Delay of recognition and management can lead to perforation, sepsis, peritonitis, and aspiration of fecal matter. As prompt intervention is imperative to avoid dire complications, healthcare providers should familiarize themselves with the demographics of susceptible patients, unreliability of physical exam, value of CT scan in diagnosis, and management options.

Severe Fecal Impaction/Obstruction

* Probability: High.
* Emergency: Very High.
* Rationale: The CT scan confirmed a large stool burden throughout the colon and dilatation of the rectum with perirectal edema. Symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake aligned with a severe bowel obstruction.

Suitable Treatments:
* removing the fecal impaction by breaking it down or physically removing it and treatment for chronic constipation"
"A 41-year-old male patient was admitted to Tungwah Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University on April 5, 2019 due to prolonged fever and upper abdominal pain. Five days before admission, he had prolonged fever for no apparent reason. The maximum body temperature was 40 °C, accompanied by chills. The body temperature reduced to normal after taking antipyretics. He began to experience upper abdominal pain 10 h before admission. Throughout the disease, he had no cough, sputum, hemoptysis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhea, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. He claimed that he had not been exposed to tuberculosis before. Outpatient chest computerized tomography (CT) showed no obvious infection lesions in the lungs (Fig. 1a,b), while chemical tests showed that amylase was 448 U/L and lipase was 1225 U/L. The patient was initially suspected of having acute pancreatitis. After admission to the hospital, CT examination of the abdomen showed that the gastric antrum-duodenum was unevenly thickened with the surrounding oozing and multiple enlarged lymph nodes (Fig. 1c,d). CT enhanced examination and electronic gastroscopy are recommended for further examination. The patient was treated for acute pancreatitis at the beginning of admission. After 6 days of treatment, his upper abdominal pain relieved, but he still had repeated fever.

The CT image c of the abdomen showing exudation and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the antrum and duodenum. Image d of the abdomen CT showing uneven thickening of gastric antrum and duodenal mucosa

After abdominal CT results came out, we performed a gastroscopy for the patient. Gastroscopy revealed that the patient had multiple gastric and duodenal ulcers (Fig. 2a,b). After biopsy, histopathology showed that the gastric antrum mucosa was chronically active inflammation and infected helicobacter pylori, and epithelioid granulomas were seen in the lamina propria, which was in line with the ulcer marginal tissue (Fig. 2c,d). Histopathology suggested tuberculosis should be considered. To find more evidence to support the diagnosis of tuberculosis, we arranged the tuberculosis antibody test, interferon-gamma release assay (T-SPOT.TB) and purified protein derivative test (PPD skin test) for the patient. The anti TB antibody test was positive, the T-SPOT.TB result was uncertain, and the PPD skin test was negative. After excluding other pathogen infections and autoimmune diseases, we arranged an empirical anti-tuberculosis program for the patient. The patient received systematic IREZ anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) for 1 week (isoniazid 0.3 g, orally once a day; rifapentine 0.45 g, orally twice a week; ethambutol 0.75 g, orally once a day; pyrazinamide, orally 3 times a day), while taking glutathione tablets to protect liver. After the third day of the anti-tuberculosis treatment process, the body temperature reduced to normal without recurring fever. One week later, the patient did not develop fever or abdominal pain again and was discharged from the hospital. After the patient was discharged from the hospital, treatment continued in the outpatient clinic. During the 12-month follow-up, the patient claimed that he did not have abdominal pain, fever, or night sweats again.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed chronic active mucosal inflammation, granulomatous inflammation, and epithelioid granulomas in the local lamina propria (c, d) (c ×200, d ×100)

Mycobacterium tuberculosis can invade the stomach through the following ways: (1) Mycobacterium tuberculosis swallowed directly invades the gastric mucosa; (2) Mycobacterium tuberculosis in other parts invades the stomach wall through the blood system or lymphatic system; (3) Mycobacterium tuberculosis from nearby organs spreads to stomach.","Diagnosis:

Gastric and duodenal tuberculosis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate. While not immediately life-threatening, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent complications and spread of the infection.
* Rationale: The presence of epithelioid granulomas in the gastric antrum mucosa, positive anti-TB antibody test, and the patients response to anti-tuberculosis treatment strongly suggest gastric and duodenal tuberculosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* 6–9 months of antituberculosis therapy in drug-susceptible cases and 12 months in drug-resistant cases"
"A 21-year-old man complained of persistent frontal headache and fever for two weeks. He was generally healthy but had tooth decay with self-interrupted treatment in the right upper teeth. He is a non-smoker and an occasional alcoholic beverage drinker. For his educational attainment, he finished high school and is working as an electrical mechanic. He suffered from drug-induced urticaria at 10 years of age. He was diagnosed with sinusitis two weeks before admission, and antibiotic treatment was initiated. However, due to the persistence and progression of headache and fever, a head MRI was performed (Figure ​(Figure1)1) during admission, which revealed a 40-mm-diameter right frontal brain abscess adjacent to the right frontal sinus on enhanced T1-weighted imaging.

Initial MRI images of the patient who presented with a severe headache.
(a) A ring-enhanced brain abscess measuring 40 mm was detected adjacent to the right frontal sinus on T1WI with contrast enhancement.

(b) The brain abscess showed a mild right-to-left deviation with extensive FLAIR high signal around the lesion.

(c) The brain abscess displayed a clear high signal on DWI.

(d) Coronal T1WI with contrast enhancement revealed slight contrast findings at the site of the previous linear fracture.

T1WI: T1-weighted image; CE: Contrast enhancement; FLAIR: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; DWI: Diffusion-weighted imaging.

He gave a history of trauma for frontal bone linear fracture, including the right frontal and maxillary sinus, with loss of consciousness. He was hospitalized for one week due to a vehicular accident four years ago. CT scan also showed an incomplete fusion of the previous skull fracture (Figure ​(Figure22).

CT images of the frontal skull fracture four years prior and the brain abscess during this admission.
(a) CT following a vehicular accident four years prior, showing a skull fracture in the right frontal and maxillary sinus.

(b) CT taken during this admission due to a brain abscess, revealing incomplete fusion of the previous skull fracture in the right frontal and maxillary sinus.

On the day of admission, he presented with somnolence and had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12-E3 V4 M5. No abnormalities were observed in the cranial nerves and limbs, and there were no cerebellar symptoms or neck stiffness. However, tenderness was noted in the frontal region upon tapping. Blood tests revealed a mildly elevated C-reactive protein and an increased WBC count (Table ​(Table1).



Two days after hospitalization, aspiration of the right frontal brain abscess was performed, through a small craniotomy from the lateral side, avoiding past fracture sites. Cultures were taken during the procedure. Intraoperative findings revealed fracture lines from a prior injury. After the drainage surgery, the patient was administered an anticonvulsant and empiric therapy with three antibiotics. This treatment is planned to continue for over eight weeks, in line with the standard treatment period [5], followed by a gradual de-escalation (Table ​(Table2).
He was persistently febrile (39°C) from the day after surgery to postoperative day (POD) 20. On POD 10, Streptococcus constellatus/milleri and Eikenella corrodens were detected in the culture; thus, antibiotic treatment was de-escalated based on drug sensitivity. For the right maxillary and frontal sinusitis, symptoms resolved on POD 11 shortly after antibiotic therapy was started. On follow-up images, residual abscess and perifocal edema gradually improved. On POD 19, generalized convulsive seizures occurred, and antiepileptic drugs were re-administered, with resolution of the seizures after. On POD 23, a bone defect at the bottom of the right maxillary sinus was found on the follow-up CT, which included the upper dental crown. Furthermore, bone translucency around the maxillary teeth was also observed (Figure ​(Figure33).

Coronal section including the upper dentition on the follow-up CT.
A tooth with root inflammation showed osteolysis and was entrenched in the maxillary sinus.

On POD 28, to address the root inflammation, the patient underwent dental extraction, which was considered the cause of the dental sinusitis. Finally, antibiotic therapy was continued for more than eight weeks until the high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging was almost resolved. The results of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III showed a verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) score of 70, a performance IQ score of 82, a full-scale IQ score of 73, a verbal comprehension score of 78, a perceptual organization score of 91, a working memory score of 74, and processing speed score of 72. The patient was discharged from the hospital with no neurological sequelae. There was no recurrence of seizures, so the antiepileptic drug was discontinued on POD 39. The electroencephalogram showed no abnormality on POD 43, and the occurrence of the generalized seizure was considered as an early postoperative seizure.

Brain Abscess

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High (Emergency)
* Rationale: MRI findings show a ring-enhanced brain abscess measuring 40 mm adjacent to the right frontal sinus. History of sinusitis, chronic tooth decay, and incomplete skull fracture fusion increase the likelihood.

Suitable Treatments:
* Surgical Drainage: Performed via a small craniotomy
* - Antibiotic Therapy: Empirically with Meropenem, Vancomycin, and Metronidazole initially; de-escalated based on culture results later
* - Anticonvulsants: Administered post-surgery, discontinued after resolution of seizures"
"An 81-year-old man visited the emergency room with transient oral hemorrhaging 10 days before admission. No persistent bleeding was observed at the time of visit. An examination by the emergency doctor did not identify any hematemesis or hemoptysis, so the patient was referred to an otolaryngologist at a later date. A few days later, an otolaryngologist examined the patient from the nasal cavity to the upper respiratory tract with a fiberscope, and a gastroenterologist examined the upper gastrointestinal tract with a fiberscope, but no obvious bleeding sites other than the gingiva were observed. The patient visited the emergency room on two more occasions, five and two days before admission, again with chief complaints of a fever and malaise.

On the day of hospitalization, he visited the emergency room a fourth time with a fever and headache. He had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement (bioprosthetic valve) for aortic stenosis, and stent placement for angina pectoris. He had been taking clopidogrel at 75 mg/day and apixaban at 5 mg/day as antithrombotic therapy. He had full dentures but had received no dental care for over 10 years. The dentures had been poorly cleaned and showed marked plaque adhesions. Marked absorption of the alveolar ridge due to periodontitis was identified. He presented with a high fever (39.1℃), headache, and drowsiness (Glasgow Coma Scale score 14). No nausea, vomiting, skin rash, seizure, or photophobia were observed. No pathological heart murmur was identified. A neurological examination revealed no evidence of Kernig sign or Brudzinski sign, but he showed mild neck stiffness and head jolt sign. No mydriasis, disturbance of light reflex, abducens nerve palsy, hearing impairment, motor paralysis, or aphasia were observed.

Laboratory tests showed the following: white blood cells, 13.0×103/μL (84% neutrophils, 12% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes); hemoglobin, 10.7 g/dL; platelet count, 10.1×104/μL; creatinine, 1.87 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 10.17 mg/dL; blood sugar, 650 mg/dL; HbA1c, 12.2%; activated partial thromboplastin time, 64.8 seconds; and prothrombin time (international normalized ratio), 1.06. This patient showed the classical triad of a fever, neck stiffness, and altered consciousness, and laboratory tests suggested the presence of infection, likely bacterial meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed increased levels of protein (60 mg/dL) and glucose (261 mg/dL) as well as pleocytosis with predominant polynuclear cells (476/mm3; 96% polynuclear, 4% mononuclear). No bacteria were found from CSF cultures, but S. oralis was confirmed from blood cultures (2 of 2 sets).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed no signal-intensity abnormalities, suggesting cerebrovascular disease (Figure A, B). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging showed neither edematous changes in the brain nor ventricular enlargement suggestive of obstructive hydrocephalus (Figure C, D). Brain atrophy was attributed to age-related changes. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain showed irregular walls of the blood vessels, considered to represent arteriosclerotic changes (Figure E). Contrast-enhanced MRI was not performed due to his chronic kidney disease. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no evidence of any vegetations or valvular abnormalities (day 2). Transesophageal echocardiography was not conducted because the patient declined to undergo this procedure.

Findings from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on admission. Diffusion-weighted imaging (A) and T2*-weighted imaging (B) show no signal-intensity abnormalities. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (C, D) shows neither edematous changes in the brain nor ventricular enlargement. Three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography shows arteriosclerotic change (E). Contrast-enhanced MRI was not performed due to the renal function being reduced by chronic kidney disease.

Three famous classical signs of meningitis (fever, neck stiffness, and altered consciousness) were found. S. oralis was detected from blood cultures, and this patient showed a potential route of invasion that can lead to odontogenic bacteremia. A CSF specimen showed pleocytosis with predominant polynuclear cells. Although no bacteria were detected from the CSF specimen, the overall diagnosis was S. oralis meningitis.

Empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy was started to cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes; ampicillin (ABPC) 6 g/day, ceftriaxone (CTRX) 4 g/day, and vancomycin (VCM) 30 mg/kg/day. The administration of dexamethasone was withheld due to concerns regarding difficulty with controlling blood sugar levels. His fever, headache, and disturbance of consciousness (DOC) slowly improved. We discontinued ABPC and VCM because in vitro testing showed that the identified S. oralis was sensitive to ABPC, CTRX, and VCM. Antibiotic treatment with CTRX was continued for 28 days due to prolonged headache. TTE performed again on day 27 did not reveal any evidence of infectious endocarditis. In parallel with pharmacotherapy, we consulted with the dental and oral surgery department and requested treatment to maintain good oral hygiene, including his dentures. We also controlled his hyperglycemia, reducing it to within an appropriate range. A complete cure had been achieved by discharge on day 34.","Diagnosis:



* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Emergency
* Rationale: The patient presents with the classical triad of meningitis (fever, neck stiffness, altered consciousness). CSF analysis and blood cultures confirmed S. oralis infection. Imaging and TTE excluded other potential sources of infection like endocarditis or other intracranial pathology.

Suitable Treatments:
* ceftriaxone 4 g/day and ampicillin 12 g/day, in addition to dexamethasone 8 mg every 6 hours
* Chlorhexidine mouthwashes were performed three times a day"
"51-year-old Mael policeman consults his general practitioner (GP) with a painful, red spot on his upper limb, overweight, territorial medicine setting.
He is not ill, has no fever, has never smoked, uses a couple of beers each day and is known with hypertension, for which he is treated with atenolol ZOC 100 mg once daily. With a length of 1.86 meters and a bodyweight of 98 kilograms he is slightly over weighted.
The spot is there for a few days and looks like an oval shaped raised erythema. His GP diagnoses a superficial thrombophlebitis and prescribes conservative treatment: elevation of the leg and compresses. Within a few weeks the string disappears. Two years later the story repeats itself in exactly the same manner, but now the spot is located on the front of his left tibia. The GP again diagnoses superficial thrombophlebitis and prescribes a NSAID. The thrombophlebitis again resolves itself in a few weeks.
A year later he consults again, this time with a swollen left calf, that started just above the ankle and a painful string at the inner side of the knee. Compression ultrasonography however shows no deep vein thrombosis, but again superficial thrombophlebitis. Treatment as before with NSAID. A year later he experiences a superficial thrombophlebitis for the fourth time (again diagnosed with compression ultrasonography) and a consulted specialist advocates screening on thrombophilia and possible malignancy. No thrombophilia is found, but PSA is slightly raised and because of a raised gamma-GT (123 U/l, which a month later spontaneously recovers to 63 U/l) a CT-scan of the abdomen is made. This reveals a solid mass in the left kidney and a solid mass in the suprarenal gland.
First diagnosis: superficial thrombophlebitis
Therapy: NSAID
A partial nephrectomy and extirpation of the suprarenal gland is performed and biopsies of his prostate are taken. The pathologist diagnosis a renal cell carcinoma of the kidney, clear cell type with a diameter of 4.3 cm, Fuhrmann grade 111-IV, an adenoma of the adrenal cortex and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason score 6.
The patient recovers of the operation, distant metastases were not found. He is treated with prostatectomia for his prostate carcinoma. A year after the first operation a metastasis of the renal cell carcinoma is found in the right suprarenal gland, which is treated by extirpation. During the two years form his first to his third operation he suffered from deep venous thrombosis twice. Now, three years after the operation he has resumed working.
Retrospectively the renal mass was visible on a scan, made in 2001 because of his hypertension, that was difficult to treat at that time. This renal mass however was not noticed at that time.
Unprovoked superficial thrombophlebitis not only carries an increased risk for developing deep vein thrombosis but it might also carry a risk for malignancy. Although empirical evidence for the association between superficial thrombophlebitis and malignancy still has to be established especially with recurrent disease doctors have to be on their guard and it might be worthwhile to screen patients with (recurrent) superficial unprovoked thrombophlebitis for malignancy.","Diagnosis:

Renal Cell Carcinoma

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The CT scan revealed a solid mass in the left kidney, which was later confirmed by biopsy as a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, with a diameter of 4.3 cm and Fuhrmann grade III-IV.

"28-year-old male patient with intraventricular hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia underwent extraventricular drainage and ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus, ED setting.
At 30 months after onset, he was admitted to the rehabilitation department of our university hospital. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed leukomalactic lesions in the hypothalamus, bilateral medial temporal lobe, and bilateral basal ganglia (Fig. (Fig.1A).1A). He showed intermittent high body temperature (maximum: 39.5°C, 38.5–39.2°C). However, he did not show any signs of infection upon physical examination or in his white blood cell count and inflammatory enzyme levels including erythrocyte sedimentation and C-reactive protein. Eight age-matched normal subjects (4 male, mean age, 26.6 years; range, 21–29 years) were enrolled in this study as control subjects. The patients father and all normal subjects has provided informed consent for publication of the case, and the local ethics committee approved the study protocol.

 

Figure 1
(A) T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance images show leukomalactic lesions in the hypothalamus (arrows), bilateral medial temporal lobe, and bilateral basal ganglia. (B) Regions of interest for the hypothalamus were localized by using the optic tract (anterior boundary), the mammillary body (posterior boundary), and the midline (medial boundary) at the level of the upper midbrain in the patient (C) and a representative normal subject.
When he showed hyperthermia during admission, we applied four types of management including external cooling methods (tepid massage and ice pack), hydration, and medication (propacetamol 1 g, intravenous injection).[11–13] He revealed similar pattern of hyperthermia in terms of intensity and frequency during two months admission at our hospital.
A multi-channel head coil on a 1.5 T Philips Gyroscan Intera (Philips, Best, Netherlands) with 32 gradients was used for the acquisition of DTI data. The patients DTI data was acquired at 30 months after stroke onset. We acquired 67 contiguous slices parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. DTI scanning parameters were as follows: acquisition matrix = 96 × 96; reconstructed to matrix = 192 × 192; field of view = 240 mm × 240 mm; repetition time = 10,398 ms; echo time = 72 ms; parallel imaging reduction factor = 2; echo-planar imaging factor = 59; b = 1000 s/mm2; number of excitations = 1; and slice thickness = 2.5 mm. Eddy current-induced image distortions were removed by using the affine multi-scale two-dimensional registration provided in the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of Brain Software Library. DTI-Studio software (CMRM, Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD) was used for evaluation of the hypothalamus, which was identified by locating the anterior boundary of the optic tract and the posterior boundary of the mammillary body at the level of the upper midbrain (Fig. (Fig.11A).[14] Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) estimates were obtained for the hypothalamus. Regions of interest for the hypothalamus were localized by using the optic tract (anterior boundary), the mammillary body (posterior boundary), and the midline (medial boundary) at the level of the upper midbrain in the patient (C) and a representative normal subject.


A summary of the DTI parameter results for the hypothalamus in the patient and the control groups is presented in Table Table1.1. The FA and ADC value of the patient were lower and higher, respectively, by more than two standard deviations from the control values (Table (Table11).

Our results suggest that evaluation of the hypothalamus by using DTI would be helpful in patients show unexplained fever following brain injury.","Diagnosis:

Central Fever

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: The hypothalamic lesions indicated by MRI, along with the absence of infectious indicators despite high body temperature, strongly suggest central fever. The hypothalamus is a crucial thermoregulatory center in the brain, and damage here can lead to dysregulation of body temperature.

"44 year old female patient had been having recurrent sinus infections every month, territorial medicine setting.
 She would get a sore throat with bad post nasal drip and cough followed by a runny nose that would lead to sinus pressure and fullness. She would get lots of mucous in her throat and need to clear it out often. This would happen every few weeks and she would end up going to Urgent Care or her primary Doctor and being told that she had a sinus infection and given antibiotics. While she would feel a little better at first the symptoms would simply come back after a period of time.
Diagnosis: recurrent infective sinusitis
Therapy: antibiotic
She was referred to an ENT doctor who examined her and decided to order a CT scan of her sinuses for her. The ENT advised her that the CT scan of her sinuses was essentially normal but that her exam showed evidence of silent acid reflux and possible allergies. She was tested for allergies and the results showed that she had mild allergies to dust, ragweed and trees. She was surprised to learn that allergies don’t always cause sneezing or itching eyes but can simply cause inflammation of the nose and sinuses. In addition the ENT advised her that her acid reflux was moderate and that she should be treated short term with a medication and to see a GI doctor if she does not get better. It was emphasized to her that diet and lifestyle changes were the best long term treatment for acid reflux. Again, she was surprised that even though she didn’t have any traditional symptoms like heartburn, she had an acid reflux problem that was causing her throat, nose and sinuses to get inflamed repeatedly. She was given an antacid medication to take for 4 weeks, advised to start doing saline rinses of her nose and sinuses everyday and to use a nasal spray to help her allergies.
She started adhering to a low acidic diet and decreased her coffee and alcohol intake in addition to the other measures advised and found that at 4 weeks her symptoms were remarkably better. Since she was improving the antacid medication was stopped. After 3 months, she was doing great and had stopped having any more sinus “infections”. Her throat felt very clear and her ability to breath through her nose was never better. She was also referred to an allergist who was able to develop a plan for her where she would not have use her allergy medications all the time.","Diagnosis:

Silent Acid Reflux

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: Silent acid reflux can cause chronic throat symptoms and sinus inflammation without typical heartburn, leading to recurrent sinus issues.

Suitable Treatments:
* PPI, lifestyle modification"
"A 58‐year‐old man presented at the emergency room with a two‐day history of headache, sore throat, cough, and fever.
He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media.
He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn (Figure 1). He had bacterial meningitis 6 years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His vital signs were Bp 160/75 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 27/min, BT 38°C, and SpO2 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils size was 4 mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae(see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes (Figure 4). Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates (Figure 4). Unfortunately, on the fifth day of admission, his physical examination continued to show GCS of 3 out of 15, and brainstem reflexes were absent. A brain perfusion scan showed no brain perfusion, and he was declared brain dead.","Diagnosis:

Bacterial Meningitis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: Patient has a history of bacterial meningitis and presents with severe headache, fever, altered sensorium, nuchal rigidity, and positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. CSF findings show high WBC count, low glucose, and high protein with pus-like appearance and presence of S. pneumoniae.

"A 44-year-old man with diabetes and a history of severe acute pancreatitis with encapsulated pancreatic necrosis in the context of hyperlipemia requiring admission to the intensive care unit.
He was admitted for a second episode of acute pancreatitis. He initially presented renal failure and metabolic acidosis requiring admission to the intensive care unit with the need for vasopressors and the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Despite antibiotic treatment, on day 7 of admission a high fever occurred, requiring antibiotic escalation with no microbiological findings. Coinciding with the onset of fever, abdominal pain in the left flank and muscle weakness was noted.
Current symptoms include hemodynamic stability, abdominal pain in the left flank on palpation controlled with analgesics, and an absence of fever. The patient remains on oral nutrition. Laboratory tests show leukocytosis of 18,000 with neutrophilia, thrombocytosis of >1,000,000, mild anemia, and CRP 59.
An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure A) without intravenous contrast performed on admission, only showed retrogastric encapsulated necrosis in relation to previous acute necrotizing pancreatitis and intraglandular and periglandular inflammatory changes that could be compatible with flare-up.
Magnetic resonance imaging (Figure B) and an abdominal CT scan with contrast (Figure C) was requested 1 month later to control the pancreatic collection, which revealed an extensive hydro-aerial collection that replaced the splenic parenchyma, showing a thick fistulous gastrosplenic tract toward the greater gastric curvature with abundant extravasation of oral contrast to the splenic collection, and an inflammatory plastron encompassing the tail of the pancreas.
Following these findings, enteral nutrition was suspended, and parenteral nutrition was started. In addition, the patient was referred to esophagogastric surgery.
 
Figures A,B and C An abdominal CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast shows the presence of an intrasplenic cavity with air inside and the existence of an abnormal communication between the stomach and spleen; digestive endoscopy confirms the presence of the fistula and allows biopsies to be taken to confirm the diagnosis of malignancy in case of suspicion.","Diagnosis:

Pancreatic Fistula

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients imaging studies reveal the presence of a fistulous connection between the stomach and the spleen, confirmed by digestive endoscopy. This is a complication of severe acute pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, common in patients with a history like this.

"A 31-year-old male patient with no prior medical history presented to the ED with high-grade fever for 2 days.
He also had chills, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, and diarrhea. He used over-the-counter acetaminophen to control his symptoms.
On admission, the patient was oriented. His vital signs were BT 38°C, BP 130/90 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, respirations were 20/m, and SpO2 was 98%. Physical examination showed no abdominal pain, no organomegaly, a negative Murphy’s sign, and no evidence of mucocutaneous bleeding. Laboratory tests were significant for thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 67.000/mm3, high hematocrit (45%), hemoglobin level of 15.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 3.310/mm3, and a positive NS1 antigen test. His liver enzymes were mildly elevated, AST was 89 U/L, and ALT was 69 U/L; serum HbsAg and HCV antibody were negative. Serum creatinine and C-reactive protein were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver and pancreas sizes, thickening gallbladder wall (8 mm), and no intraperitoneal fluid was noted. Chest X-ray was unremarkable.
In the hospital, his diarrhea was worsening, more than 5 times a day. On the fifth day after the onset of fever, he started to have burning-like abdominal pain, which was localized in the epigastrium and radiated to the back. He had 2-3 episodes of nausea and vomiting per day. He also developed petechiae over his lower limbs. Laboratory results showed elevated serum amylase (174 U/L) and lipase (606 U/L). Platelet count decreased to 10.000/U, hematocrit was 51%, leukocyte count was 5.200/mm3, and serum triglyceride was 3.81 mmol/L (Table 1). Plain abdominal computed tomography revealed an enlarged pancreas, peripancreatic fat stranding, and peripancreatic fluid collection (Balthazar score D) along with a minimal right pleural effusion (Figure 1). He was managed with intravenous fluids, analgesics, antacid, and bowel rest. Two days later, his clinical condition became stable, he started to be afebrile, the abdominal pain was resolved, and his platelet cell count was trending up. Subsequently, he was discharged without complications.
Noncontrast abdominal CT findings were consistent with acute pancreatitis, Balthazar grade D.

* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of a high-grade fever, headache, muscle aches, petechiae, and a positive NS1 antigen test strongly suggest dengue fever. Thrombocytopenia, increased hematocrit, and fluid accumulation in the body align with severe dengue (formerly known as dengue hemorrhagic fever). The presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, and elevated liver enzymes also support this diagnosis.

"A 23-year-old young male patient of slim build presented to the accident and ED with sudden-onset chest pain and shortness of breath.
He had pleuritic chest pain, worse on breathing. Electrocardiogram showed right axis deviation, diminished or low-amplitude R waves and small-amplitude QRS complexes in the precordial leads. Vital signs were stable and physical examination showed reduced air entry on the left side. Chest radiography showed significant left-sided pneumothorax and the patient had an emergency chest drain inserted. ECG changes resolved with the resolution of pneumothorax. He was discharged home after four days of hospital admission and complete resolution of pneumothorax.

"A 23-year-old man, suspected of having arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, underwent right heart catheterization for electrophysiology testing, via left femoral vein approach, and placement of an ICD, through the left subclavian vein.
Five days later, he presented to the emergency department (ED) of our institution because of left pleuritic chest pain. On examination, he showed RR 22/m, BT 36.1°C, and slightly diminished breath sounds over the left lung base. SpO2 was 98% on ambient air. Electrocardiogram confirmed the presence of a known incomplete right bundle brunch block with T-wave inversions in leads V1–V3, in the absence of other remarkable findings, except for heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Chest radiograph revealed mild left pleural effusion. The patient was discharged with diagnosis of pleurisy and a seven-day amoxicillin clavulanate treatment was prescribed.
Twelve days later, the patient newly presented to the hospital and was admitted to our medical ward, because of a 3-day history of right pleuritic chest pain, cough, and high-grade fever. His physical examination and vital signs showed BT of 38.4°C, arterial BP of 105/70 mmHg, HR of 105 bpm, RR of 20/m, right basal hypophonesis on chest auscultation, no heart murmurs, no leg swelling, no enlarged lymph nodes, and no local signs of ICD pocket infection. A new chest radiograph documented bilateral mild pleural effusion and consolidation at the right lung base. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no cardiac dysfunction and excluded recognizable endocardial or ICD leads vegetation. Laboratory tests revealed a normal white blood cells count, with lymphocytosis and presence of atypical lymphocytes. C-reactive protein level was high (16.4 mg/dL), and procalcitonin was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnosis of pneumonia and consensual pleural effusion was proposed and after drawing blood cultures, the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

On the third hospital day, the patient’s clinical picture was unchanged, despite antibiotic treatment. Absence of clinical improvement and persistent atypical lymphocytosis triggered a point-of-care thoracoabdominal ultrasound examination, which was conducted at the bedside by one of the internal medicine physicians caring for the patient, using a MyLab 40 US portable system (Esaote) equipped with a 3.5 MHz convex transducer. Abdominal examination detected splenomegaly (craniocaudal length of 14 cm). Chest sonography showed mild bilateral pleural effusion and pleurally based, hypoechoic, wedge, and rounded shaped lung consolidations (2 in the lower left lobe and 1 in the lower right lobe, maximum size 50 mm) presenting scant or absent bronchoaerogram (Figure 1). Thoracic findings were suggestive of PE and infarction; nevertheless, the association of multiple lung consolidations, fever and other sepsis signs, and history of ICD placement oriented diagnostic suspicion toward a SPE complicating ICD leads infection. With the aim of a more sensitive assessment of endocardial and ICD leads involvement, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was ordered, which was refused by the patient. Empiric vancomycin treatment was added to cover methicillin-resistant staphylococci. A chest contrast enhanced CT scan documented filling defects within pulmonary arteries for posterior basal segments of both lungs and confirmed the presence of basal subpleural consolidations compatible with infarct lesions. No reliable images of lung abscess were detected. Furthermore, an abdominal CT scan revealed thrombosis of the left iliofemoral vein, site of recent percutaneous puncture for cardiac catheterization. A definitive diagnosis of PE complicating iliofemoral vein thrombosis was formulated, and the patient was started on rivaroxaban. Considering the association of atypical lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, and prolonged fever, a concomitant viral illness was suspected; serologic testing confirmed an EBV primary infection (Table 2). All blood cultures drawn during hospital stay (6 sets) were negative, and procalcitonin remained persistently normal. In the absence of reliable imaging and laboratory findings of bacterial infection, antibiotics were withheld on day 7 after admission. Pleuritic chest pain and fever disappeared on day 9, and the patient was discharged home. Ambulatory controls in the following weeks showed excellent clinical conditions and progressive normalization of laboratory tests. Rivaroxaban was stopped after 3 months and the patient had an uneventful course.

"A 37-year-old male patient with a background of hypertension was admitted to our emergency department with sudden dizziness and left limb weakness.
Non-jet vomiting occurred before transfer to our hospital for further management, and the vomitus was gastric content. He reported no trauma, fever, or coma, he was a non-smoker, and he had no history of drug use or cardiac events. The patient was immediately subjected to a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, which revealed hemorrhage in the occipital and parietal lobes. The diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was made. He developed sudden onset chest tightness, shortness of breath, and occasional chest pain behind the sternum around 48 h after emergency hematoma evacuation. The pain was stuffy in nature and did not radiate to other places. His symptoms continued to worsen gradually, until breath sounds were observed when the patient was sitting up. There were no severe symptoms of dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis or sputum (a characteristic pink frothy sputum is often produced).
History of present illness
The patient’s medical history was only hypertension; he had not been treated regularly, and the blood pressure control was unknown. There was no other history of illness or medication.
Physical examination
The patient had warm extremities with hemodynamically stable with vital signs of BP 128/73 mmHg and a HR of 77 beats per minute (bpm) on initial assessment. He was breathing smoothly on room air with clear lungs. His cardiac examination was normal and did not show any murmurs or gallops.
The physical examination was unremarkable, except for the low left limb muscle tension and the third limb muscle strength. The physical examination was carried out when the patient suffered from chest tightness. On further examination, his heart rate was faster than 100 bpm and his blood pressure had risen to 150/90 mmHg; other general conditions were stable. However, when the patient was breathing in a sitting position, auscultation revealed abnormal breath sounds, which manifested as obvious bilateral bubbling rales in the lower part of the lungs.
Laboratory examinations
The serum level of creatine kinase (CK) was 837 U/L (reference range, 38-174 U/L), that of CK isoenzyme was 26 U/L (reference range, 2-25 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 269 U/L (reference range, 109-245 U/L) and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) was 249 U/L (reference range, 72-182 U/L) at admission; other blood values were within the normal range. When the symptoms of chest tightness worsened, the patient’s blood was immediately checked for any sign of heart failure (HF). The laboratory examination showed the concentration of N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 493 pg/mL (reference range, < 85 pg/mL). Myocardial enzyme levels, including cTnI, did not exhibit normal values after serial determination: the cTnI level was increased to 0.175 ng/mL in the resting state (reference range, < 0.06 ng/mL), the CK level was 660 U/L, the CK-MB level was 26 U/L, LDH was 298 U/L, and HBDH was 271 U/L. Repeated measurements 5 d later showed the values had decreased: CPK, 49 U/L; CK-MB, 12 U/L; LDH, 231 U/L; and HBDH, 187 U/L (Figure (Figure11).

Imaging examinations
On admission, the emergency cerebral CT image revealed cerebral hemorrhage in the occipital and parietal lobes (Figure (Figure2),2), while the initial 12-lead ECG (Figure (Figure3A)3A) revealed a normal sinus rhythm and a regular rate within the normal range; however, T wave inversions and ST segment in leads V5 and V6 were already observed.

We made another ECG at the onset of chest tightness. It is notable that the ECG demonstrated extensive depression of the ST segment and T wave inversion, suggestive of myocardial injury. At this time, there was a prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc, 487 ms) (Figure (Figure3B).3B). But at this time, the chest radiograph showed no bilateral patchy opacities that are typical of pulmonary edema and consistent with the breath sounds when the patient was in a sitting position (Figure (Figure4).

 Figure 4
Chest radiography at 1 d after left heart failure.

In sum, the working hypothesis of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) could be established. Further cardiological investigations, including coronary arteries with CT angiogram (CTA) of the coronary arteries, were needed to make a definite diagnosis. Considering the patient was in acute stage of ICH, coronary angiography was not timely completed.
A coronary CTA and echocardiogram (ECHO) were made at 72 h after the initial symptoms when the patient’s chest discomfort disappeared. The ECHO revealed normal sized chambers with an ejection fraction of 60% and showed no significant valvular abnormality or any wall motion abnormality (Figure (Figure5).5). Coronary arteries did not reveal any sign of obstruction or significant narrowing (Figure (Figure6).6). Another 12-lead ECG was made 11 d after the patient’s symptoms improved, by this time, the patient had returned to the same state as at admission with the recovery of ICH, but the QTc interval was now prolonged (QTc, 424 ms).

"55-year-old, overweight, Caucasian male, who was transferred from an outside hospital, presented with bradycardia (heart rate was between 20 and 30 beats per minute upon admission), ED setting.
He was admitted to the outside hospital a day prior to being transferred with a 3-week history of progressively worsening generalized malaise, flu-like symptoms, and dyspnea on exertion. He also reported experiencing dyspnea on exertion and near syncope for the past week and a half. He denied experiencing any chest pain, heart palpitations, or cold intolerance. His medical history included myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, status post stent placement in 2011, hypertension, Crohn’s disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. His home medications included aspirin 81 mg once daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily, folic acid 1 mg daily, isosorbide mononitrate extended-release 60 mg once daily, lisinopril 2.5 mg once daily, mercaptopurine 100 mg twice daily, mesalamine 800 mg twice daily, ranolazine extended-release 1000 mg twice daily, and simvastatin 40 mg once daily. He had no known drug allergies. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Notably, he worked as a taxidermist at a farm. Upon initial examination, he noted having several tick bites a few weeks ago while working at his job, after which he developed erythema migrans on his right arm and abdomen. He denied any recent travel history.
Physical examination revealed vital signs of HR 40 bpm, BP 134/74 mmHg, RR 20/m, and BT of 36°C. The review of systems was remarkable for an erythematous macular rash with central clearing on the anterior aspect of right arm. Laboratory tests, including troponin I (reference <0.04 ng/mL), were unremarkable. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a second-degree AV block, fluctuating between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II heart block, with a P-R interval of 300 ms. The patient was transferred to cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) for closer monitoring. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western immunoblot tests were performed and sent to the laboratory for analysis. A presumptive diagnosis of Lyme carditis was established based on the confirmed history of tick exposure, presence of erythema migrans, and AV block. The patient was started on ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. In addition, heparin 5000 units/mL subcutaneous injection every 12 hours was initiated for venous thromboembolism prevention. All of the patient’s home medications, except carvedilol and lisinopril, were restarted. Carvedilol, a nonselective β-blocker and α1 blocker, was held to prevent the patient’s heart rate from dropping further and worsening his bradycardia. Cardiac Electrophysiology Service was consulted and agreed with the primary team’s plan for conservative management and did not see a need for a pacemaker placement.
On day 3 of hospitalization, patient’s heart rate was found to be between 50 and 60 beats per minute. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed based on the presence of Borrelia antibodies demonstrated by ELISA and Western immunoblot findings (positive for IgG and IgM anti-Borrelia antibodies). A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 60% to 65%, normal right ventricular systolic function, and no significant valve disease. A repeat ECG revealed a first-degree AV block with a P-R interval of 300 ms. When compared with the initial ECG, the patient was no longer in second-degree AV block. As the patient’s second-degree heart block had resolved, he was transferred from the CVICU to the general medicine floor, where he continued to receive ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours.
On day 5 of hospitalization, there was a marked improvement in the patient’s clinical status; though, he continued to experience weakness and fatigue. After the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter line, the patient was discharged to his home on a 28-day course of ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. On the day of discharge, the patient’s vitals were as follows: heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98 degree Fahrenheit. The patient did not develop any neurologic symptoms of Lyme disease over the course of his hospital stay. Upon discharge, all of patient’s home medications, including carvedilol and lisinopril, were restarted. In addition, the patient was instructed to follow-up with his primary care physician and cardiologist on an outpatient basis.","Diagnosis:

Clinical examination of the lesions revealed painful erythematous nodules, hypertrophic scars, and multiple sinuses with purulent discharge, erosions, hyperpigmented macules, and papules on both breasts as well as between the breasts (Figure 1). The sondage test on the intermammary area was positive (Figure 2), indicating a positive sinus tract formation. Histopathological examination from skin biopsy on the intermammary area revealed follicular occlusion, follicular hyperkeratosis, destroyed hair follicles, as well as apocrine glands and hair follicles surrounded by massive inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes (Figure 3). This histopathological finding supported the diagnosis of HS. Once-daily 600 mg rifampicin and twice-daily 300 mg clindamycin were given to the patient for 10 weeks. The skin lesion improved on the third week of observation.

"A 29-year-old male farmer was admitted to the hospital (ED setting) with abdominal pain, appetite loss, and diarrhea as his main complaints for the last 2 weeks.
The patient was hospitalized after presenting with heat, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, watery diarrhea, back pain, and generalized body aches over the previous 2 weeks. The patient has been farming in an area where manure has been used as fertilizer for the past 12 years. In the past, he had grown vegetables and crops in animal manure. After eating lunch at roughly 3 p.m., the patient started experiencing diarrhea at midnight. The symptoms did not improve after treatment with antidiarrheal and antipyretics for a few days. After worsening symptoms, he was transported to the hospital and was diagnosed with probable enteric fever based on his medical history, which revealed poor hygiene, fever, gastrointestinal pain, and lettuce consumption. His financial situation makes it clear that he must utilize animal manure to grow vegetables and other crops more quickly because he cannot purchase artificial fertilizers.
The patient grew lettuce this season since he loved it so much. The vegetables had recently become ripe enough to be sliced, eaten, or sold. He brought home some of the lettuce from work one day. He ate it for dinner, but after it had been left out in an open space within the house for a few days. Within 12 hours of consumption, the farmer exhibited the aforementioned clinical signs. We decided to identify the disease type through laboratory investigations and diagnostic criteria after the patient stated, ""I had reason to believe typhoid fever because the lettuce I ate was grown on animal manure and not washed with fresh water after keeping it at home for some days.""
Physical examination revealed a high-grade fever (BT 41°C), a coated tongue, mild dehydration, heart palpitations, a HR of 112 bpm, a RR of 14/m, and a BP reading of 118/78 mmHg. The results of the remaining tests were uneventful. Blood cultures were obtained and other laboratory investigations were performed. Table Table11 lists the results of the laboratory investigations.

No malaria parasites were found in the thick and thin peripheral blood smear examination. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and pelvis was done to rule out any local complication which was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed lymphopenia and a decreased white blood cell count. The patient received paracetamol for fever and metronidazole for diarrhea and prevention of pseudomembranous colitis. The patient recovered within 7 days, and none of his relatives had the same symptoms.
On admission, ciprofloxacin 500 mg was started twice daily for 7 days to treat typhoid by suppressing the growth of S. Typhi DNA topoisomerase and DNA gyrase. Paracetamol 500 mg was administered three times daily for 7 days starting on the same day to reduce the temperature by preventing prostaglandin E2 secretion, which increases heat secretion and decreases heat loss. Most of the patients symptoms disappeared after 6 to 7 days, except for a low-grade fever that was still present. Seven days after the order for blood culture, a blood culture report was also obtained. The culture report showed S. Typhi isolation after 7 days, which was sensitive to azithromycin, amikacin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. The culture report also reported resistance to cefoperazone/sulbactam, co-trimoxazole, cefixime, cefotaxime, and amoxicillin. The patient was hospitalized, treated for typhoid fever, and sent home with the necessary medication. On follow-up after 2 weeks, the patient was doing fine.","Diagnosis:

"A two-month-old girl was transferred from a local hospital to the pediatric ICU of a tertiary hospital because of cough and wheezing for 10 days, which worsened after six days.
The child had a history of asphyxia and weak physical condition. She was diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia and was hospitalized for seven days at another hospital.
On admission, the infant had an acute facial appearance, with anhidrosis on the left side of the face, hyperhidrosis on the right side, tachypnea, and three depressions sign. After oral ibuprofen administration and physical cooling, the body temperature decreased slowly. When fever was high, the patient experienced convulsions, cough, wheezing, and diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) performed at another hospital revealed a high-density shadow in the right lower lung and a large soft tissue mass in the posterior mediastinum. Enhanced CT tomography revealed a space-occupying lesion in the posterior mediastinum. Combined with the results for neuron-specific enolase (71.72 ng/mL), the possibility of neuroblastoma was considered. The patient subsequently underwent mediastinal tumor resection under general anesthesia, and the surgery was successful. The child had persistent symptoms, such as fever, convulsions, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness, postoperatively. After the relevant examinations, paraneoplastic syndrome was considered, and isotretinoin was administered orally to induce tumor differentiation.
The child had multiple infections during hospitalization. After admission, the result of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae nucleic acid test of the throat swab was 4.024×E5Copies/mL, indicating the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Subsequent bacterial culture of the tracheal tube tip suggested hemolytic Staphylococcus, indicating the presence of bacterial infection. The1–3 -β-D-glucan test was 160.79pg/mL, and Aspergillus galactomannan test was 0.35ug/L, indicating fungal infection. To control and prevent further infection, a variety of antibiotics, such as cefotaxime sodium, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefoperazone sulbactam sodium, azithromycin, vancomycin, meropenem, linezolid, voriconazole, and metronidazole, are used throughout the hospital stay. During the third month of hospitalization, the patient’s sputum smear showed a large number of gram-positive bacilli outside the white blood cells on Gram staining (Figure 1A) and weak acid-fast staining was positive (Figure 1B). The sputum culture grew dry, rough, branched, and slightly yellow-pigmented colonies on Columbia Blood Agar Base Medium (Figure 1Cand D). MALDI-TOF MS of Merieux VITEK MS identity the colonies as Tsukamurella species (Figure 2A), and the DNA (Ezup column bacterial genomic DNA extraction kit, sangon Biotech, Shanghai) of the bacterial strain was extracted for 16S rRNA sequencing (sangon Biotech, Shanghai), and the base pair matching of the sequencing results showed that the Query Cover 99%, E value 0.0, per.ident 99.80%. After sequencing and comparing the results, the colony from the sputum was determined to be Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens, which was subsequently cultured from the tracheal apex catheter of the patient. MALDI-TOF MS compared with 16S rRNA, time and cost advantages, but can only be identified to species level, and there is a certain error detection rate.4Unfortunately, despite active treatments, such as anti-infection, immune regulation with gamma globulin, methylprednisolone pulse therapy, intravenous nutritional support, and invasive ventilator-assisted ventilation, the patient’s family required abandonment of treatment due to her critical condition and threatened life. The patient was discharged with a stomach tube during the third month of hospitalization.

"A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with intermittent diarrhea for the previous 5 days, which developed soon after eating food that he believed was contaminated. He also had reduced urine volume for the previous 3 days.
Physical examination
Examination on admission showed that his temperature was 38.5 °C, HR was 128 bpm, respiration was 2/m, and BP was 70/40 mmHg. There was no evidence of lung or cardiac abnormalities. His abdomen was slightly puffy and soft, with upper abdominal pressure, and he experienced back pain and bowel “chirping” 5-6 times/min.
Laboratory examinations
His hemoglobin level was 18.3 g/dL, the total white blood cell count was 21.4 × 109/L, there were 71.9% neutral granulocytes, and the platelet count was 169 × 109/L. The patient also had metabolic acidosis, with a blood gas pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 30 mmHg, PO2 of 66 mmHg (FiO2 60%), PO2/FiO2 of 110 mmHg, bicarbonate of 16.6 mmol/L, a base excess of -9.0 mmol/L, and lactate of 3.5 mmol/L. The aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) was 573.1 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 47 U/L, total bilirubin was 7.58 µmol/L, serum creatinine (SCr) was 708.8 µmol/L, urea was 20.48 mmol/L, and albumin was 26.9 g/L. The prothrombin time was 12.5 s, activated partial thromboplastin time was 31.3 s, international normalized ratio was 1.08, and procalcitonin (PCT) was 32.60 ng/mL. Because the ASP was highly elevated and the AST was moderately elevated, we conducted tests to determine the possible cause. All tests for hepatitis (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb, and HCV) were negative, as were all tests for autoimmune hepatitis (antinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antigen, soluble liver antigen antibodies, liver-kidney microsome-1, and other autoantibodies).
Salmonella and Shigella were not detected in a stool culture, and the tests for Clostridium difficile toxin A toxin B were also negative. Most fecal cocci were Gram-negative bacilli, and there were a few Gram-positive.
Empirical treatment with meropenem began within 1 h of admission, and blood cultures were obtained. The blood culture showed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to meropenem, so we continued its use.
According to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)[6], we diagnosed the patient as having Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia, sepsis, septic shock, and septic AKI. His Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was 18 points, with a 42.9% risk of death, and his Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 10.
The patient was in critical condition. To treat the sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, we administered 2500 mL of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 h and established invasive dynamic hemodynamic monitoring. Following the initial fluid resuscitation, we performed frequent reassessment of his hemodynamic status to guide administration of additional fluids. The patients blood pressure increased slightly to 80/55 mmHg, and we administered noradrenaline to achieve the initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg.
We also initiated CRRT using an oXiris®hemofilter (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, United States), which is designed for removal of cytokines adsorption of endotoxins, using a Prismaflex version 8.0 machine (Gambro Industries, Meyzieu, France). A vascular path was established using a 12-French double-lumen catheter in the right femoral vein. The prescription was set up as pre-dilution. The mode of CRRT was continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at 30 mL/kg per hour, and the CRRT machine was primed with normal heparinized saline and regional citrate for anticoagulation. The blood flow rate was 150 L/min. The hemofiltration prescription was adjusted based on electrolyte and acid-base results and the oXiris® hemofilter was changed every 12 h to ensure adsorption efficacy. Except for mild hypocalcemia, which required intravenous calcium supplementation, the patient experienced no significant complications.
After administering meropenem and CRRT with the oXiris® filter for 72 h, the patients vital signs were stable, and the infection was well controlled. We also reduced the noradrenaline infusion to a minimum of 0.05 µg/kg per minute during the CRRT, and stopped it at 65 h after initiation of treatment. After 6 h, the lactate level was 2.1 mmol/L and lactate clearance rate was 40%. At that time, inflammation-related parameters [endotoxin, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10] had markedly declined. In addition, the PCT level decreased from 32.60 ng/mL to 4.98 ng/mL during the 72 h treatment period (Figure (Figure2A).2A). His urine volume gradually increased over the course of 10 d (Figure (Figure2B).2B). Over the course of 3 d, his SCr gradually decreased from 708.8 µmol/L to 241 µmol/L, his SOFA score decreased from 10 to 3 , and his APACHE II score decreased from 18 to 6. After he was hemodynamically stable, we changed to a traditional filter (AN69 hemofilter) and used intermittent CVVHDF. We discontinued CRRT after the recovery of kidney function on day 20. After 25 d of treatment in the ICU, there was significant amelioration of the septic shock, and we discharged the patient. The patients kidney function eventually returned to normal.","Diagnosis:

"63-year-old Aboriginal man was referred by a general practitioner to a rural hospital emergency department. The patient presented with 24 hours of epigastric pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea, generalized muscle aches, and fever. The preceding night, the patient had eaten a piece of chicken that he had cooked after it had been refrigerated for a few days. The patient was an ex-smoker, was moderately obese, and had long-standing type 2 diabetes being treated with insulin and complicated by diabetic nephropathy (baseline serum creatinine 300–320 μmol/L) and peripheral vascular disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II symptoms), hypertension, and depression. Over the preceding 2 years, he had been managed in the outpatient heart failure clinic with review every 6–8 weeks. His heart failure symptoms had been deemed to be stable at his last review 6 weeks before presentation. The patient’s regular medications were low-dose aspirin, bisoprolol, fluvoxamine, gliclazide MR, insulin glargine, fenofibrate, simvastatin, and inhaled fluticasone/salmeterol. The patient lived alone and was functionally independent with activities of daily living.
Upon presentation to hospital, his initial examination was remarkable only for fever. Blood biochemistry showed raised inflammatory markers and chronically elevated creatinine (Table 1). The patient was admitted to the general medical ward of a rural district hospital for supportive treatment with a presumptive diagnosis of infective gastroenteritis. Initial management included intravenous fluid rehydration and antiemetics. His fluid status was monitored, and his regular medications, including insulin and inhaled bronchodilators, were continued.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient continued to have intermittent high fevers. Empirical antibiotics were commenced (intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g three times daily). Blood cultures subsequently grew C. perfringens and E. avium; both organisms were sensitive to penicillin. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated cholelithiasis but was otherwise normal (Fig. Fig. 1). Specialist infectious disease advice was sought on two occasions, which confirmed appropriate antibiotic management. The patient continued to remain clinically stable.
Fig. 1
 
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in a patient with suspected gastroenteritis. Image was obtained within 24 hours of presentation to the hospital. CT demonstrated cholelithiasis but no other abnormality
Viral nasopharyngeal swabs were also positive for human metapneumovirus. The results of fecal nucleic acid testing were negative for other common pathogenic organisms, including enteric viruses, parasites, and bacteria. The results of viral and autoimmune hepatitis screening were negative. Urine culture performed prior to initiating antibiotics was clear. Blood film obtained 48 hours after admission showed neutrophilic toxic changes.
On the third day after presentation, the patient became visibly jaundiced and complained of mild intermittent epigastric pain. Blood biochemistry showed acute renal and hepatic injury and hyperbilirubinemia suggestive of intravascular hemolysis (Table 1). The patient was urgently transferred to a tertiary center, given the risk of deterioration.
The patient’s condition significantly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was admitted to intensive care with septic shock and renal failure. He required support with multiple inotropes and dialysis. Antibiotic cover was extended to include vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin (Table 2). Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small bowel enteritis, hepatic infarction, and portal vein thrombosis suspected to be septic thromboembolism. CT also demonstrated several hepatic hypodensities consistent with multiple abscesses, the largest measuring 41 mm in diameter (Fig. 2). Ultrasound-guided drainage was performed, and 35 ml of hemoturbid fluid was aspirated. The result of culture of the hepatic abscess was positive for E. avium.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis 72 hours after presentation to the hospital showing multiple lobulated intrahepatic collections, infarction of hepatic segments 5 and 8, and septic occlusion of the portal vein. There were no gas locules associated with the abscesses. CT also demonstrated small bowel enteritis (not shown)
The patient developed refractory septic and cardiogenic shock and required intubation and ventilation. Intubation was complicated by bronchial bleeding that required transfusion and endobronchial intervention. The patient had been temporarily commenced on therapeutic heparin for portal vein thrombosis; however, this was rapidly reversed with Prothrombinex®-VF (CSL Behring, Victoria, Australia) [7]. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (estimated LV ejection fraction, 21%) but no evidence of valvular dysfunction or infective endocarditis. Despite maximal intensive care support, including intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation, the patient died 2 days after admission to intensive care, 6 days after his initial presentation.

Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens is an aerobic, weakly acid-fast, non-motile, gram-positive bacterium that colonizes various environments and can infect immunocompromised patients. Confusions are easily made when distinguishing between Actinomycetes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens. After culturing pure colonies of this strain, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the gradient diffusion method were performed (Table 1). DNA of the strain was extracted and sent for high-throughput sequencing (Uniteomics, Tianjin). Basic genomic information was also analyzed. Based on the genomic information, a constructed genome circle map described the relational and multidimensional data (Figure 2B). The pure colonies were subjected to scanning electron microscopy to further explore their morphology characteristics (Figure 3) (Xiangya Medical College of Central South University).","Diagnosis:

"A 59-year-old man was admitted to the ED with intermittent diarrhea for the previous 5 d, which developed soon after eating food that he believed was contaminated.
He also had reduced urine volume for the previous 3 d (Table (Table11).
Physical examination
Examination on admission showed that his temperature was 38.5 °C, pulse (HR) was 128 bpm, RR was 22/min, and blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg. There was no evidence of lung or cardiac abnormalities. His abdomen was slightly puffy and soft, with upper abdominal pressure, and he experienced back pain and bowel “chirping” 5-6 times/min.
Laboratory examinations
His hemoglobin level was 18.3 g/dL, the total white blood cell count was 21.4x10^9/L, there were 71.9% neutral granulocytes, and the platelet count was 169x10^9/L. The patient also had metabolic acidosis, with a blood gas pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 30 mmHg, PO2 of 66 mmHg (FiO2 60%), PO2/FiO2 of 110 mmHg, bicarbonate of 16.6 mmol/L, a base excess of -9.0 mmol/L, and lactate of 3.5 mmol/L. The aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) was 573.1 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 47 U/L, total bilirubin was 7.58 µmol/L, serum creatinine (SCr) was 708.8 µmol/L, urea was 20.48 mmol/L, and albumin was 26.9 g/L. The prothrombin time was 12.5 s, activated partial thromboplastin time was 31.3 s, international normalized ratio was 1.08, and procalcitonin (PCT) was 32.60 ng/mL. Because the ASP was highly elevated and the AST was moderately elevated, we conducted tests to determine the possible cause. All tests for hepatitis (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb, and HCV) were negative, as were all tests for autoimmune hepatitis (antinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antigen, soluble liver antigen antibodies, liver-kidney microsome-1, and other autoantibodies).
Salmonella and Shigella were not detected in a stool culture, and the tests for Clostridium difficile toxin A toxin B were also negative. Most fecal cocci were Gram-negative bacilli, and there were a few Gram-positive.
Empirical treatment with meropenem began within 1 h of admission, and blood cultures were obtained. The blood culture showed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to meropenem, so we continued its use.
According to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)[6], we diagnosed the patient as having Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia, sepsis, septic shock, and septic AKI. His Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was 18 points, with a 42.9% risk of death, and his Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 10.
The patient was in critical condition. To treat the sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, we administered 2500 mL of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 h and established invasive dynamic hemodynamic monitoring. Following the initial fluid resuscitation, we performed frequent reassessment of his hemodynamic status to guide administration of additional fluids. The patients blood pressure increased slightly to 80/55 mmHg, and we administered noradrenaline to achieve the initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg.
We also initiated CRRT using an oXiris®hemofilter (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, United States), which is designed for removal of cytokines adsorption of endotoxins, using a Prismaflex version 8.0 machine (Gambro Industries, Meyzieu, France). A vascular path was established using a 12-French double-lumen catheter in the right femoral vein. The prescription was set up as pre-dilution. The mode of CRRT was continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at 30 mL/kg per hour, and the CRRT machine was primed with normal heparinized saline and regional citrate for anticoagulation. The blood flow rate was 150 L/min. The hemofiltration prescription was adjusted based on electrolyte and acid-base results and the oXiris® hemofilter was changed every 12 h to ensure adsorption efficacy. Except for mild hypocalcemia, which required intravenous calcium supplementation, the patient experienced no significant complications.
After administering meropenem and CRRT with the oXiris® filter for 72 h, the patients vital signs were stable, and the infection was well controlled. We also reduced the noradrenaline infusion to a minimum of 0.05 µg/kg per minute during the CRRT, and stopped it at 65 h after initiation of treatment (Figure (Figure1A).1A). After 6 h, the lactate level was 2.1 mmol/L and lactate clearance rate was 40%. At that time, inflammation-related parameters [endotoxin, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10] had markedly declined (Figure (Figure1B1B--D).D). In addition, the PCT level decreased from 32.60 ng/mL to 4.98 ng/mL during the 72 h treatment period (Figure (Figure2A).2A). His urine volume gradually increased over the course of 10 d (Figure (Figure2B).2B). Over the course of 3 d, his SCr gradually decreased from 708.8 µmol/L to 241 µmol/L, his SOFA score decreased from 10 to 3 (Figure (Figure2C),2C), and his APACHE II score decreased from 18 to 6 (Figure (Figure2D).2D). After he was hemodynamically stable, we changed to a traditional filter (AN69 hemofilter) and used intermittent CVVHDF. We discontinued CRRT after the recovery of kidney function on day 20. After 25 d of treatment in the ICU, there was significant amelioration of the septic shock, and we discharged the patient. The patients kidney function eventually returned to normal.","Diagnosis:

"63-year-old Aboriginal man was referred by a general practitioner to a rural hospital emergency department, ex-smoker, obese, and had long-standing type 2 diabetes being treated with insulin and complicated by diabetic nephropathy (baseline serum creatinine 300–320 μmol/L) and peripheral vascular disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II symptoms), hypertension, and depression.
 The patient presented with 24 hours of epigastric pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea, generalized muscle aches, and fever. The preceding night, the patient had eaten a piece of chicken that he had cooked after it had been refrigerated for a few days.. Over the preceding 2 years, he had been managed in the outpatient heart failure clinic with review every 6–8 weeks. His heart failure symptoms had been deemed to be stable at his last review 6 weeks before presentation. The patient’s regular medications were low-dose aspirin, bisoprolol, fluvoxamine, gliclazide MR, insulin glargine, fenofibrate, simvastatin, and inhaled fluticasone/salmeterol. The patient lived alone and was functionally independent with activities of daily living.
Upon presentation to hospital, his initial examination was remarkable only for fever. Blood biochemistry showed raised inflammatory markers and chronically elevated creatinine (Table 1). The patient was admitted to the general medical ward of a rural district hospital for supportive treatment with a presumptive diagnosis of infective gastroenteritis. Initial management included intravenous fluid rehydration and antiemetics. His fluid status was monitored, and his regular medications, including insulin and inhaled bronchodilators, were continued.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient continued to have intermittent high fevers. Empirical antibiotics were commenced (intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g three times daily). Blood cultures subsequently grew C. perfringens and E. avium; both organisms were sensitive to penicillin. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated cholelithiasis but was otherwise normal (Fig. Fig. 1). Specialist infectious disease advice was sought on two occasions, which confirmed appropriate antibiotic management. The patient continued to remain clinically stable.
Fig. 1
 
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in a patient with suspected gastroenteritis. Image was obtained within 24 hours of presentation to the hospital. CT demonstrated cholelithiasis but no other abnormality
Viral nasopharyngeal swabs were also positive for human metapneumovirus. The results of fecal nucleic acid testing were negative for other common pathogenic organisms, including enteric viruses, parasites, and bacteria. The results of viral and autoimmune hepatitis screening were negative. Urine culture performed prior to initiating antibiotics was clear. Blood film obtained 48 hours after admission showed neutrophilic toxic changes.
On the third day after presentation, the patient became visibly jaundiced and complained of mild intermittent epigastric pain. Blood biochemistry showed acute renal and hepatic injury and hyperbilirubinemia suggestive of intravascular hemolysis (Table 1). The patient was urgently transferred to a tertiary center, given the risk of deterioration.
The patient’s condition significantly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was admitted to intensive care with septic shock and renal failure. He required support with multiple inotropes and dialysis. Antibiotic cover was extended to include vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin (Table 2). Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small bowel enteritis, hepatic infarction, and portal vein thrombosis suspected to be septic thromboembolism. CT also demonstrated several hepatic hypodensities consistent with multiple abscesses, the largest measuring 41 mm in diameter (Fig. 2). Ultrasound-guided drainage was performed, and 35 ml of hemoturbid fluid was aspirated. The result of culture of the hepatic abscess was positive for E. avium.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis 72 hours after presentation to the hospital showing multiple lobulated intrahepatic collections, infarction of hepatic segments 5 and 8, and septic occlusion of the portal vein. There were no gas locules associated with the abscesses. CT also demonstrated small bowel enteritis (not shown)
The patient developed refractory septic and cardiogenic shock and required intubation and ventilation. Intubation was complicated by bronchial bleeding that required transfusion and endobronchial intervention. The patient had been temporarily commenced on therapeutic heparin for portal vein thrombosis; however, this was rapidly reversed with Prothrombinex®-VF (CSL Behring, Victoria, Australia) [7]. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (estimated LV ejection fraction, 21%) but no evidence of valvular dysfunction or infective endocarditis. Despite maximal intensive care support, including intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation, the patient died 2 days after admission to intensive care, 6 days after his initial presentation.

"45-year-old woman, normal weight (BMI 24.1 kg/m2), suffering from chronic migraine without aura. She had a regular menstrual cycle and was not taking hormones.

She taked galcanezumab (120 mg monthly), which was able to significantly reduce the frequency of migraines. She reported a decrease in libido after starting treatment. She also reported gaining four kilograms in nine months without changing her lifestyle.

After taking galcanezumab for nearly eleven months, she decided to stop treatment, believing that the relief from migraine symptoms was not worth the side effects of weight gain and loss of libido.

After stopping galcanezumab, she noticed an improvement in her libido over the next two months. According to the authors, no significant changes in the womans personal situation that could influence her libido were noted, with the exception of starting treatment with galcanezumab.

The patietn did not present disorders such as dyspareunia, vaginismus, anorgasmia, or a phobic aversion to physical-sexual contact or symptoms of (peri)menopause, the authors interpreted the cases presented as “sexual arousal disorder”.

According to the authors, the genesis of this malaise is attributable to the peripheral consequences of CGRP blockade rather than to central effects. In their opinion, a direct central effect of the antibodies was unlikely, as, due to their size, they were unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier in significant quantities.

The exact role of CGRP in sexual arousal has not yet been fully clarified, Linda Al-Hassany and colleagues report. However, immunohistochemical tests on human clitoral tissues have shown that the peptide is present, especially in the sensory C fibers and in colocalization with substance P. The peptide appears to be involved in the physiology of the clitoris by exerting sensory and vasodilatory effects, similar to those exerted on the penis.

Additionally, CGRP acts as a neurotransmitter in the vagina, where it regulates blood flow and capillary permeability. Consequently, blocking the effects of CGRP with antibodies could lead to a reduced genital response, including decreased vaginal lubrication.","Diagnosis:

"21 year old woman, consulted with a one day history of sore throat. She did not complain of cough or of any other associated respiratory symptom.
On examination she was feverish (BT 38°C), with exudate on her tonsils and tender cervical lymph nodes. A textbook of diagnostic strategies suggests that this collection of symptoms and signs increases the likelihood of her having group A β haemolytic streptococcus infection to over 40%. She was treated with a seven day course of penicillin, and a throat swab was taken to confirm infection with group A β haemolytic streptococcus. Four days later the swab result confirmed the presence of group A β haemolytic streptococcus which was sensitive to penicillin. Nine days after the initial consultation Ms H returned complaining of continuing symptoms of sore throat and requesting further antibiotics. She still had inflamed tonsils but with no exudate; her cervical lymphadenopathy had persisted. In view of her positive throat swab she was given a further course of penicillin. Serology for infectious mononucleosis was negative. A subsequent consultation confirmed that her sore throat had settled two days after the second consultation.","Diagnosis:

Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Moderate
* Rationale: Initial clinical presentation including fever, exudative tonsillitis, and tender cervical lymphadenopathy strongly suggests GABHS infection. This is further supported by the swab confirmatory test.

"17 year old woman, consulted with a two day history of sore throat and blocked nose. Examination revealed an inflamed pharynx with some exudate, but the patient was otherwise well. She had been treated with two consecutive courses of antibiotics for a similar illness in 1997. She was keen to have antibiotics again. After some negotiation a compromise was reached: antibiotics were not prescribed, but a throat swab was taken. A week later the swab result confirmed group A haemolytic streptococcus (non-β) reported as sensitive to penicillin, and a letter with a prescription was sent to Ms D after contact by telephone failed. One week after this the patient complained to the practice manager that she still had a sore throat. Her sister had been seen the day before (by a different doctor) with the same symptoms and was prescribed antibiotics immediately. An appointment to see the doctor concerned to discuss the complaint was made, but the patient failed to attend.
Questions
The throat swab is currently recommended as a diagnostic aid in patients with sore throat.3The quoted sensitivity (26-30%) and specificity (73-80%), however, are low when compared with the “gold standard” of a rise in antistreptolysin O titre.6 The antistreptolysin O titre is probably the best predictor for the presence of group A β haemolytic streptococcus, the most common bacterial pathogen causing sore throat, as the association with definite cases of rheumatic fever and high initial level of antistreptolysin O titre or rise in antistreptolysin O titre is 100%.7 The low predictive value of throat swabs is probably due to a high symptomless carriage rate of group A β haemolytic streptococcus (ranging from 6% to 40%).7 Although antistreptolysin O titre may be a better gold standard, it is not suitable for routine use because of delay, cost, and the inconvenience of serial titres. As the first case illustrates, if the throat culture is positive it is difficult not to prescribe further antibiotics.
What are the benefits and risks of prescribing antibiotics?
The rationale behind treating people with sore throat with antibiotics is to reduce symptoms and the likelihood of developing suppurative and non-suppurative complications.
Symptom relief
The Cochrane review reports that 90% of all (treated and untreated) patients are well one week after the onset of symptoms.2 Those treated with antibiotics for sore throat, headache, and fever have reduced symptoms on day three. The maximum benefit is at three and a half days, when the symptoms of half the treated patients have already settled.
Suppurative complications
Quinsy is rare in general practice.8 Most randomised controlled trials exclude patients at high risk of suppurative complications. Despite these exclusions, the Cochrane review shows that the rate of complication with quinsy is significantly reduced with antibiotics.2 However, this finding is based on a single trial reported in 1951 that contributed 15 of the 19 patients with quinsy in the untreated group.
Non-suppurative complications
Rheumatic fever is similarly rare in general practice. In trials from the 1950s, however, treatment of exudative tonsillitis with penicillin did reduce the incidence of subsequent rheumatic fever.2 Moreover, patients who have developed complications (either suppurative or non-suppurative) may not have had a preceding sore throat, and of those with prior symptoms, only a minority will seek medical help.7,8
Disadvantages of prescribing antibiotics
The risks of prescribing antibiotics have been well described. These include the common side effects of antibiotics (diarrhoea, rashes, candidiasis, unplanned pregnancy secondary to oral contraceptive failure) and the rare occurrence of anaphylaxis. Another consequence is to “medicalise” the condition of sore throat, resulting in increasing reattendance for future episodes of this condition.5Furthermore, there is evidence that by treating patients positive for group A β haemolytic streptococcus, the modest benefits of treatment at the beginning of the episode of illness may be negated because of increased likelihood of such an infection recurring.9When the direct costs of prescribing and the impact on bacterial resistance are also considered, the use of antibiotics is clearly not a risk free strategy.
Using a throat swab as a diagnostic test in primary care may medicalise the condition and encourage prescribing.6 Guidelines from the United States and the United Kingdom recommend prescribing antibiotics in patients in whom group A β haemolytic streptococcus has been identified.10,11 We believe that this advice ignores the fact that no satisfactory diagnostic test can identify these patients.
Very ill patients have, because of exclusion on clinical grounds, been poorly represented in randomised controlled trials.2,4 These patients may be the individuals most likely to benefit from antibiotics. For the vast majority of patients with a sore throat, however, the trade-off between risks and benefits from antibiotics is, at best, marginal.
These diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas ignore the patient’s perspective. In the United Kingdom, most patients consult for reassurance and information; only a minority expect to receive antibiotics. Doctors often prescribe antibiotics to maintain good relationships with their patients. What patients require is consistent information that addresses their concerns and beliefs.12,13 Our cases illustrate that the priority in consultations should be to elicit patients’ concerns and provide sufficient information for a joint management decision to be reached.","Diagnosis:

Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis

* Probability: High (Due to positive throat swab for group A haemolytic streptococcus (non-β))
* Emergency: Moderate

"34-year-old woman presented to the emergency department for evaluation of a 12-hour history of sudden severe epigastric pain and bilateral leg weakness during exercise associated with nausea and vomiting.
 She experienced 2 episodes of diarrhea; 1 of which was blood streaked. The patient reported not eating or drinking much that day. She described a few previous less severe episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea since childhood associated with certain foods. She denied fever or chills but reported a 5-lb intentional weight loss during the past month. She denied changes in her appetite, myalgia, arthralgia, or vision changes. She had no recent travel, sick contacts, or antibiotic drug use. She denied current pregnancy.
The patient was previously healthy; her medical history included recurrent urinary tract infections and infertility, with a previous artificial insemination attempt resulting in a missed abortion. Current medication use includes clomiphene and progesterone vaginal suppository.
At presentation, her vital signs were as follows: body temperature 36.9°C; heart rate 69 beats/min; respiratory rate 16 breaths/min; and blood pressure  98/60 mmHg. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but was in no acute distress. Her abdomen was soft and nondistended, with positive bowel sounds. She had generalized tenderness in all 4 quadrants, with absence of guarding and rebound tenderness. Her mucous membranes appeared dry. Lower extremity strength was normal. Results of a urine pregnancy test obtained on arrival to the emergency department were negative.
The clinical presentation and CT findings suggest colitis. The differential diagnosis for the cause of colitis includes infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic etiologies. Imaging studies are nonspecific and do not differentiate between these etiologies of colitis.
A serum lactate level could refer to either a serum l-lactate or a serum d-lactate level. An elevated serum l-lactate level would indicate either tissue hypoxia (type A lactic acidosis) or decreased clearance of lactic acid, which occurs most commonly with liver disease (type B lactic acidosis). d-Lactate is produced by bacteria in the gut and is metabolized slowly by humans. Patients with short-bowel syndrome can develop lactic acidosis from elevated serum levels of d-lactate. An elevated serum lactate level would not confirm the diagnosis of colitis or clarify the underlying etiology.


Endoscopy is the preferred method for confirming the diagnosis and cause of colitis. In this patient, flexible sigmoidoscopy would not allow visualization of the affected areas of bowel; therefore, colonoscopy is the best test to confirm the diagnosis.
Mesenteric angiography would not be the next step in the evaluation of colitis. It may play a role in the evaluation of ischemic colitis if there is isolated right-sided colonic involvement (possible superior mesenteric artery occlusion) or if there is a question as to whether a patient has mesenteric ischemia or colonic ischemia.
A colonoscopy was performed next and showed areas of irregular erosion and ulceration starting at the splenic flexure and involving the distal colon. The mucosa in the distal ileum, as well as the cecum; ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon; and rectum, appeared normal. A biopsy of the area of segmental colitis showed edema and hemorrhage in the lamina propria and superficial epithelial necrosis.
In patients with findings of colitis on CT, stool antimicrobial assessment (including Clostridium difficile toxin testing) to assess for infectious colitis is often completed before proceeding with colonoscopy. In this case, stool antimicrobial assessment was initiated but not completed before colonoscopy. The patients ongoing abdominal pain and the distribution of colonic lesions on CT, which raised concern for skip lesions of Crohn disease, led to the pursuit of early colonoscopy. Stool assessment ultimately revealed few fecal leukocytes and a negative polymerase chain reaction result for Shiga toxin. The stool cultures for enteric pathogens were negative for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Aeromonas.
In ulcerative colitis, one would expect to see mucosal disease (erythema, edema, hemorrhage, or ulceration) starting at the rectum and extending proximally. Biopsy findings would include diffuse crypt architectural irregularity and reduced crypt numbers.5,6 The rectal mucosa was not involved in this case, making ulcerative colitis unlikely. Crohn disease could account for the colonic and distal ileal involvement seen on CT; however, on a colonoscopy one would expect to see a cobblestone pattern of ulcerations enclosing islands of normal mucosa.5 Biopsy findings would include granulomas and focal or patchy inflammation.6
Transient ischemic colitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The scattered erosions and ulcerations seen on the colonoscopy, combined with the biopsy findings of superficial mucosal edema, hemorrhage, and epithelial necrosis, are classic.7 Other findings on the colonoscopy in ischemic colitis include edematous and fragile mucosa, scattered erythema, purple hemorrhagic nodules, and sharp demarcation of the area of involved bowel. In severe forms of ischemic colitis, the mucosa appears cyanotic, and pseudomembranes, pseudopolyps, and pseudotumors may be seen. In gangrenous ischemic colitis, bluish-black mucosal nodules may be present.8
The clinical suspicion for infectious colitis was low in this case because the patient had no recent travel or dietary history to suggest exposure to enteric pathogens. Furthermore, results of stool studies were negative. The patient was treated supportively for a diagnosis of transient ischemic colitis based on her colonoscopy and clinical presentation. Her abdominal pain resolved, and she continued to remain free of recurrence of diarrhea or GI bleeding. She did not experience any recurrent lower extremity weakness with ambulation.
The right colon is infrequently involved in ischemic colitis. It most commonly involves watershed areas of the bowel, such as the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction.8In one series, the splenic flexure was involved in 57% of patients, and the sigmoid and rectum were involved in 9%.9 Involvement of the left colon (80%) is much more common than that of the right colon (4.7%).8
The most common presenting symptoms of ischemic colitis include abdominal pain (49%-78%), GI bleeding (62%-77%), and diarrhea (33%-38%).8,9 Age is a risk factor for ischemic colitis, with elderly patients being at a higher risk than young, healthy patients. In addition, females are at higher risk for ischemic colitis than are males. Other risk factors include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, constipation, and the use of predisposing medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, antihypertensives, laxatives, oral contraceptives, and anticonvulsants).1,2,8-10 Hypotension and hypovolemia, not cardiac thromboembolism, are the most common mechanisms by which ischemic colitis occurs.2
This patients clinical presentation with abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and diarrhea is consistent with a typical case of ischemic colitis. Her young age, lack of comorbid disease, and absence of predisposing medication use, however, make her case atypical. She was at risk for hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake and exercise when her symptoms developed, and she was hypotensive at presentation. Her hypotension and hypovolemia were treated by intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline on hospital admission. The hypotension responded to fluid rehydration, with no further recurrence during hospitalization.
Most cases of ischemic colitis are of a mild form (transient ischemic colitis) that resolves with supportive measures, including intravenous hydration, hemodynamic stabilization, discontinuation of offending medications, bowel rest, and antibiotic drug therapy.2,4 It can be difficult on initial presentation to distinguish mild forms of ischemic colitis from severe forms that may require surgical intervention. One risk factor for more severe disease associated with worse outcomes is right-sided colonic involvement.11
Eighteen percent of patients develop chronic ischemic colitis.11 They may experience diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, or GI bleeding, and their disease may progress to stricture formation or gangrene.4 Malnutrition from protein-losing enteropathy and symptomatic stricture are indications for surgical intervention in patients with chronic ischemic colitis.2
The role of hypercoagulable states in the pathogenesis of ischemic colitis is unclear. There is no evidence that diagnosing and treating a hypercoagulable state in a patient with an initial episode of colonic ischemia is beneficial.
This young woman was treated conservatively with intravenous fluids and morphine. She was counseled regarding the importance of maintaining adequate hydration before, during, and after exercise. She was discharged from the hospital and did not report recurrence of abdominal pain or bloody diarrhea during 1-year follow-up.","Diagnosis:

Transient Ischemic Colitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and diarrhea, all symptoms consistent with ischemic colitis. The colonoscopy findings of scattered erosions and ulcerations, combined with biopsy results showing superficial mucosal edema, hemorrhage, and epithelial necrosis, are definitive for this condition. The low response to travel history and dietary exposure and negative stool studies for enteric pathogens rule out infectious etiologies.

Suitable Treatments:
* Fluids challenge, antibiotics, support therapy"
"A 51-year-old Chinese woman, who had a past medical history of end stage renal failure, parathyroidectomy, hemithyroidectomy, was admitted in June 2015 for acute abdomen and shock.
Upon initial assessment, she was found to have tachycardia, borderline blood pressure, confusion and abdominal peritoneal signs.
Her white cell count was 16.1x103/uL (neutrophils 85.1%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 16 mm/h. The results of chemistry studies included a total bilirubin of 1.67 mg/dL with direct bilirubin 0.62 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 610 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase of 193 IU/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase of 275 IU/L. At presentation, her clotting profile was normal.
Emergency ultrasound revealed a gallbladder filled with hyperechoic substances. Gallbladder wall was thickened with hypervascularity. Sonographic Murphys sign was positive. Low-level internal echoes were present within the ascitic fluid in the pelvis and the Morrisons pouch (Fig. 1).
 
Fig. 1. Grayscale ultrasound (left) and power doppler ultrasound (right). Echogenic substances represent hemobilia (asterisk).
Immediate contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed. It confirmed hemoperitoneum and distended gallbladder filled with blood and perforation at its fundus. Active contrast extravasation was noted at its wall. Hypodense filling defects inside the gallbladder may represent polypoid growth. Overall finding could be due to acalculous cholecystitis or underlying gallbladder tumor with hemorrhage.
Patient was arranged for emergency embolization. With retrograde right femoral approach, SMA angiogram showed a replaced right hepatic artery from superior mesenteric artery, with active contrast extravasation from the cystic artery of the gallbladder. Celiac angiogram showed no supply to bleeders. Superselective catheterization of the cystic artery was achieved, followed by embolization using particles and coils to the main supplying branch and main cystic artery (Fig. 3).
In order to tide over the acute episode, our interventional radiologist offered percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy to the patient, using a 7Fr single-step drainage catheter with ultrasound guidance. Blood clot was removed by manual aspiration. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparotomy and cholecystostomy on the following day. Pathology report of the specimen confirmed acute on chronic inflammation with hemorrhagic necrosis and incidental note of gallbladder polyps.

Post procedural digital subtraction angiography demonstrates multiple microcoils (arrowhead) within the proximal cystic artery, with complete occlusion of the artery and nonopacification of the distal part.
After hemodynamic stabilization, for patients who are not surgical candidates, a cholecystostomy is an option. There was a report of hemorrhagic cholecystitis treated with a cholecystostomy and urokinase therapy [11]. Urgent percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy was undertaken in our case using a 7 Fr single-step drainage catheter with ultrasound guidance and blood clots were aspirated. It was followed by cholecystectomyon the ensuing day. In summary, hemorrhagic cholecystitis is rare but its fatal complications are not rare. The condition warrants a high index of suspicion.","Diagnosis:

"51-year-old man was transferred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, complaining of watery diarrhea and bloody stools for the past 12 hours and abdominal pain along with shortness of breath for the past 4 hours.
Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient consumed large quantities of suspected contaminated food. Twelve hours before admission, the patient began to develop watery diarrhea alternating with bloody stools, with a total volume of about 500 mL, accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. Eight hours later, the patient developed abdominal pain, accompanied by shortness of breath, pallor and sweating with no complaints of fever and chills.
The patient had a previous medical history of hypertension and gout over ten years but was poorly compliant to medical treatment. His surgical history was nonsignificant. He had a twenty pack-year history of drinking and denied any other specific personal or family history of other diseases.
Physical examination upon admission revealed a temperature of 36 °C, tachycardia at 102 bpm, tachypnea with RR of 40/m and hypotensive shock with blood pressure at 59/38 mmHg. The patient was somnolent and poorly responsive. Both lungs were covered with rales and phlegm sounds on auscultation. The abdomen was distended and slight tensed, tenderness and rebound tenderness were not elicited due to comatose state of the patient. No other pathological signs were noted.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (17.72×10E9cells/L) with predominantly neutrophils (94%), mild anemia (94 g/L) and a normal platelet count (173×10E9 cells/L). Liver and renal function tests showed elevated transaminases (ALT 1,999 U/L and AST 3,099 U/L), serum creatinine (213 µmol/L), serum uric acid (503 µmol/L), serum potassium (6.65 mmol/L) and a decreased albumin (26.9 g/L). Serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were increased at 554 mg/L and greater than 100 ng/mL respectively. Arterial-blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed acidosis (pH 7.2), normocapnia (pCO2 32.8 mmHg) and hypoxemia (pO229.9mmHg) with hyperlactemia (lactate concentration 13.5 mmol/L). On admission, a Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral pneumonia with consolidation in the upper lobe of the right lung (Figure 1A). The abdominal CT scan revealed diffuse peritonitis and marked edema with thickening of the small intestinal walls (Figure 1B,C).
 
Figure 1 Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the patient. (A) Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pneumonia with consolidation in upper lobe of the right lung and air bronchogram sign; (B) contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan showed diffuse peritonitis and marked edema of the small intestine with significant enhancement of the intestinal wall; (C) coronal reconstruction of abdominal CT showed thickening and edema of the intestine; (D) bedside chest radiography showed significant improvement of the upper lobe of the right lung.
The patient who presented with respiratory failure, hyperkalemia and septic shock, was immediately started on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, aggressive fluid resuscitation with vasopressors dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and drotaverine to relieve gastrointestinal cramps. Initial diagnosis of severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and acute severe gastroenteritis was based on the clinical findings including patient history, symptoms and work-up findings. Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with meropenem 2 g TID, tigecycline 100 mg BID and moxifloxacin 0.4 g QD was administered. Hydrocortisone 0.1 g TID was injected to reduce the inflammatory response. In addition, high-dose gamma globulin was given to boost immunity along with human serum albumin, hepatoprotective treatment and nutrition support. On October 24, 2018, we initiated ventilator weaning protocols when inflammatory indices and ABG values of the patient significantly improved and bedside chest X-rays showed significant improvement (Figure 1D). On October 24, 2018 diarrhea recurred with a daily volume of 500–1,000 mL. Sputum and blood cultures were negative, but urine and stool cultures were positive for Candida albicans. Intravenous antifungal therapy with caspofungin 500 mg QD was administered. On October 27, 2018, gastrointestinal hemorrhage recurred as hematochezia and hematemesis, with a total volume of 2,000 mL. After failure of conservative treatment, a laparotomy was finally performed revealing multisegmental bowel necrosis from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum with severe congestion and dark purple appearance and multiple mesenteric ulcer and abscesses, rupture of the small intestine 70 cm proximal to the ileocecum. The necrotic bowel was then resected (Figure 2). Histopathological examination of the resected bowel showed extensive inflammation and necrosis of the mucosa, partial intestinal wall full-thickness necrosis, subserosal hemorrhage and fibrinoid vascular necrosis accompanied by endovascular thrombosis, with large-scale local infiltration of neutrophils, suggestive of AHNE (Figure 3). The final diagnosis of the presented case was AHNE. On November 2, 2018, the patient developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding (about 3,000 mL), prompting a second emergency laparotomy for hemostasis. The patient postoperatively developed necrosis at the incision site which complicated with infection (Figure 2D). He unfortunately died of the disease on December 3, 2018 following repeated bouts of hemorrhage and infection despite active medical treatment and multiple surgical interventions (for details of the course, see Figure 4). All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013). The patient and his legal guardian provided informed written consent for publication of this study and any accompanying images during the treatment.
 
Figure 2 Operative picture of the patient. (A) Laparotomy revealed multisegmental bowel necrosis from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum with severe congestion, edema and dark purple appearance; rupture of the small intestine 70 cm proximal to the ileocecum was visible (see the arrow); (B) multiple mesenteric ulcer and abscesses were visible (see the arrow); (C) the lesions were segmentally distributed and involved the serosa; transmural necrosis and hemorrhage were visible; (D) post-operative incision site necrosis complicated with infection.","Diagnosis:

Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Enteritis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate (Life-threatening)
* Rationale: AHNE is characterized by acute onset of gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding) and often correlates with ingestion of contaminated food. The CT findings, histopathological confirmation, and clinical progression support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* fluid challenge, vasoconstrictor, antibiotics, support therapy, surgery"
"43-year-old nonsmoking female with a past medical history of Marfan syndrome, Mitral valve prolapse, and a 4.0 cm dilated ascending aorta who presented to her cardiologist after being diagnosed with an abdominal aortic dissection.
 The patient noted that the left side of her abdomen protruded more when standing compared to the right. She denied associated abdominal, chest, or back pain. The patient was told that she may have a hernia in the past.
Because she was concerned about the asymmetry of her abdomen, she ordered an abdominal CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast which showed a 5.5 cm abdominal aortic dissection. The patient was reluctant to go to the hospital until she saw her cardiologist a few days later, who recommended hospitalization and a consult for cardiothoracic surgery.
Interestingly, when the patient was seen in the hospital, she again denied chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. She only mentioned that her left side of the abdomen protrudes more than the right side when standing. On physical exam, patient had several features typical to Marfan sindrome: she was tall, had a high arched palate, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum, and her arm span was greater than her height. Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, had normal bowel sounds, and no pulsatile mass was appreciated. However, when the patient stood up, it was clear that the left side of her abdomen was bulging out in comparison to the right. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a dissecting aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to 5.6 cm (Figure 1); the false lumen supplied the left common iliac artery and the true lumen supplied the right common iliac artery. There was no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.

 

Figure 1
CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast demonstrating dissection of the abdominal aorta.
The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on a nitroglycerin drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and recommended the patient to undergo open surgical repair of the abdominal aortic dissection. In order to risk stratify the patient prior to the procedure, the patient underwent a regadenoson nuclear medicine stress test, which was low risk for ischemia. The patient underwent successful repair of her abdominal aortic dissection via a minimally invasive open retroperitoneal approach. She tolerated the procedure well without postoperative complications.
The patient came into the hospital with no home medications. As she has reported in the past, she was tried on nebivolol but had failed it due to syncope. Given this, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID was started cautiously to provide long-term benefits for the patients abdominal and thoracic aorta. The patient tolerated this medication well and was safely discharged home with close cardiovascular follow-up.","Diagnosis:

Abdominal Aortic Dissection

"58‐year‐old man presented at the emergency room with a two‐day history of headache, sore throat, cough, and fever.
He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media.
 He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn (Figure 1). He had bacterial meningitis 6 years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75 mm Hg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils size was 4 mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae(see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes (Figure 4). Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates (Figure 4). Unfortunately, on the fifth day of admission, his physical examination continued to show GCS of 3 out of 15, and brainstem reflexes were absent. A brain perfusion scan showed no brain perfusion, and he was declared brain dead.
NB
Our patients history of chronic otitis media with mastoiditis was possibly the most important factor of the recurrent severe bacterial meningitis. Otitis media have many serious complications, including mastoiditis, labyrinthitis, seventh cranial nerve palsy, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, and cerebral venous thrombosis. 6 Acute bacterial meningitis is a devastating complication of otitis media with a reported mortality rate of 41% and chronic otitis media was the cause in 74% of the morality cases.

"By A 55-year-old female patient was admitted to a peripheral hospital and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis due to salmonella.
Her stay was complicated by bacterial meningitis based on clinical symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9, and positive meningismus signs. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further management where the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was confirmed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis from a lumbar puncture (LP) that showed (WBC) 35,811/mic liter; neutrophils 85 %; protein 383 mg/dl; glucose 103 mg/dl. CSF PCR revealed Streptococcus pneumonia. Unenhanced CT-brain showed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where she was intubated and started on cefepime 2 g IV Q8h, vancomycin 1 g IV Q12h and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV 12 hourly. On day 3, the patient had two episodes of high-grade fever of 39.4 °C with generalized seizures and deterioration in mental status so there was an escalation in antibiotics and was put on valproic acid 1 g IV 12 hourly. The patient improved clinically in the next few days and was extubated in the ICU. Blood cultures showed no bacterial growth with mildly elevated CRP and WBC on blood analysis.
On day 9, the patient started complaining of dizziness and headache. On day 14, the patient suddenly developed generalized weakness. Neurological examination showed left proportional hemiplegia. MRI brain showed an area of restricted diffusion with no corresponding enhancement in the right pons which may denote a sub-acute ischemic lesion (Fig. 1).
 

Fig. 1. Diffusion-weighted sequence shows an area of restricted diffusion in the right pons, as evidenced by the high signal intensity of the lesion. (Black arrow).
Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) revealed no evidence of endocarditis; hence, septic emboli were ruled out as a possible cause of the ischemic stroke. On day 16, CT brain without contrast was compared to the previous MRI examination and showed an area of hypodensity in the pons confirming a subacute ischemic stroke (Fig. 2). The patient was still febrile (38.1 °C). A second lumbar puncture (LP) showed clear CSF: CSF white blood cells (WBC) 437/ mic liter; neutrophils 60 %; CSF protein 149 mg/dl; CSF glucose 55 mg/dl. CSF PCR was negative for streptococcus pneumonia. Screening for other infections was negative. On day 18, no improvement was noted and the patient’s level of consciousness was decreasing with a GCS score of 4, generalized seizures and recurrent episodes of high-grade fever for which the patient was reintubated. EEG was negative for sub-clinical seizures. Blood cultures were negative for nocardia. HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody enzyme immunoassay screening was negative. CSF Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) smear was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CSF PCR was also negative for tuberculosis and other possible infectious agents. In the ICU, the patient’s symptoms have totally resolved after administration of dexamethasone 8 mg IV Q8h for 3 days. For this reason, a non-infectious inflammatory process was suspected. Immunology testing was positive for Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA) and cryoglobulins and negative for P-ANCA and C-ANCA. A second MRI brain revealed new restricted diffusion areas in both thalami more prominent on the left side denoting acute ischemic lesions (Fig. 3). Another TEE showed no vegetations, hence, absence of any source of septic emboli. Atrial fibrillationwas also ruled out as another source of septic emboli by using a cardiac Holter monitor. On day 25, the patient had no more episodes of fever. She improved over the coming days and was discharged home with a GCS of 14. The patient was put on oral Prednisone 20 mg 12 hourly for one week followed by a dosage of 10 mg TID for an additional week. The patient also was prescribed Vancomycin 1 g IV Q12h and Cefepime 2 g IV Q8h for one week. The patient exhibited upon discharge sustained consciousness, articulate verbal communication, and the capacity for autonomous meal intake. Motor evaluation demonstrated significant improvement with mild weakness on the left side. Notably, the patient was discharged utilizing a wheelchair as the primary means of mobility. A structured rehabilitation plan, featuring daily physiotherapy sessions, was promptly implemented to address ambulatory limitations. The rehabilitation regimen concentrates on gait training, balance refinement, and muscular strength development. MRI brain 1 month after discharge showed features of normal ischemic changes translated by reduced sequence abnormality on FLAIR and DW (Fig. 4). Following four months of rehabilitation, left sided weakness has totally resolved.

"A 68-year-old heavy smoker with no previous medical history and no known history of allergy or asthma was brought to the emergency department after an episode of near cardiac arrest and with persistent severe hypotension. On the day of admission, the patient had made spicy pork kidneys for a dinner. Approximately an hour later, he was found by his wife gasping on the armchair. Telephone-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed for 15 minutes. Upon the arrival of an ambulance, spontaneous circulation had already been restored, although the patient remained severely hypotensive requiring norepinephrine administration. On physical examination the patient was afebrile, tachycardic and tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 85% while breathing room air. He was drowsy yet awake with Glasgow coma scale of 4-5-6. Auscultation of the heart failed to reveal any murmurs, lung sounds were clear, and the abdomen was soft with no tenderness or guarding. Skin examination did not reveal any efflorescence, although a tick embedded in the skin was extracted. Due to insufficient mechanics of breathing caused by CPR-associated rib fractures, mechanical ventilation was initiated.

An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia without signs of acute ischaemia. Laboratory results came back with a white cell count of 14,700 per cubic millimetre with predominantly neutrophils; C-reactive protein was elevated to 64 mg/l with grey-zone procalcitonin (0.1 ng/ml). Renal functions and hepatic enzymes were normal, but lactate was markedly elevated (6.3 mmol/l). Bed-side echocardiography failed to reveal hypovolemia or any regional dyskinesis or akinesis, there were no signs of right ventricular strain or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) – only high left ventricle ejection fraction consistent with hyperkinetic circulation. Whole-body CT showed only a consolidation of the lower lobe in the left lung, leading to suspicion of pneumonia.

While treating the patient empirically for pneumonia and septic shock, the medical team continued to obtain thorough history. His wife noted that her husband started to feel itches all over after eating his lunch. The precipitous speed of deterioration as well as the postprandial timing together with the additional information about itchy skin prompted us to seek an alternative diagnosis. Since protracted anaphylaxis had become a compelling unifying diagnosis, a serum tryptase sample was obtained, which came back significantly higher than normal (52.9 mcg/l; reference value is 11 under mcg/l) and total IgE levels were also elevated.

An investigation of the potential trigger left only two options – spices or pork kidneys. Taking into account the delay of the allergic reaction and the tick extracted on admission, we started to consider alpha-gal syndrome. We obtained specific IgE against alpha-gal which were highly positive (85 kIU/l, normal value 0.35 kIU/l). An allergologist consultation was requested, and the patient was diagnosed with alpha-gal syndrome as a causative factor of vasoplegic shock with rapid progression to cardiac arrest.","Diagnosis:

Alpha-gal Syndrome-Induced Anaphylaxis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: Critical
* Rationale: The patient’s sudden onset of symptoms postprandial (after eating pork kidneys), the presence of a tick bite, elevated serum tryptase, elevated specific IgE against alpha-gal, and the absence of prior allergic or asthmatic history suggest this diagnosis. The rapid development of severe hypotension and near cardiac arrest are hallmark signs of anaphylaxis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine is essential
* Continuous norepinephrine infusion to manage persistent hypotension
* Corticosteroids and antihistamines (such as intravenous methylprednisolone and diphenhydramine) to mitigate ongoing allergic response
* H1 and H2 antagonists (like ranitidine) might also be helpful
* Mechanical ventilation support is critical due to inadequate spontaneous breathing
* Avoidance of mammalian meat and products in the future, management by an allergist, and patient education about alpha-gal syndrome"
"The 54-year-old woman went to the allergic clinic in 2012 with symptoms of intensified runny nose, nose itchiness, and its blockade. These ailments had been recurring for a few years. She also mentioned the presence of cutaneous changes being some kind of papules on the basis of erythema, placed in the vicinity of haired head skin, cheeks, neck, and lobule of auricle. As a result of the applied diagnostics, allergic rhinitis in the tenor of polyvalent allergy and contact eczema from irritation was recognised. After applied treatment there was an upswing: significantly reduced nose and skin ailments. Half of a year ago the patient, while seeing a doctor, reported the presence of intensified pouring of watery rheum from the nose, nose blockage, and pain of several joints. Based on data from the interview she was directed to the rheumatology clinic. As a result of noticing antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in her organism, combined with clinical symptoms, she was hospitalised in an isolation ward with the suspicion of joint Lyme disease. In the period of intensified ailments from the side of respiratory tract and joints, she had IL-33 level measured. This was done in the framework of statutory diagnosis. The gauge was done by drawing a sample of blood from the veins (from the ulnar vein) into a tube with a separation gel – consisting of no anticoagulant, which was left for 30 min at room temperature. Then, after the sample curdled, it was centrifuged for 20 min at 2500 rpm (1000 × g), then serum was separated by division into three tubes and stored at 70°C. The concentration of IL-33 was marked with the use of immunoenzymatic method ELISA (Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), using the ready set of agents SEB 694Hu. The gauge range of the kit was from 15.6 to 1000 ng/ml. After the initial dilution of the 10,000 pg/ml standard, the following standards were acquired: 1000 pg/ml, 500 pg/ml, 250 pg/ml, 125 pg/ml, 62.5 pg/ml, 31.2 pg/ml, and 15.6 pg/ml. Within the set a plate was used with 96 dimples surfaced with antibodies specific for IL-33, conjugated with biotin (in the study, as well as the ill woman, 59 other ill people and 19 volunteers took part). After adding the standards and serum, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37ºC. The content was agitated and then 100 ml of the Reagent A was added. After this, the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37ºC. After threefold sluicing of the dimples, 100 ml of Reagent B was added, then everything was incubated for the next 30 min at 37ºC. The content was agitated and the plate was sluiced five times. Ninety ml of substract solution (TMB) was added and the plate was incubated again for 20 min at the same temperature (protecting the plate from sunlight). Afterwards, 50 ml of a solution of sulphuric acid was added (Stop Solution) with the aim to end the reaction. The plate was measured using an ELISA reader with the wavelength equal to 450 nm with the capability of automatic concentration calculation. The concentration of IL-33 in the samples was defined comparing the optical density of the studied sample to the standard curve. The statutory measurement was approved by the Bioethical Commission.
In the patient’ s case, down to the fact that her rhinitis was surmised to have allergic basis, skin prick tests were conducted with the set of basic inhalation allergens, according to the Polish Allergological Society, and food allergens (Table 1).
It was stated that the tests were positive in the case of hazel, rye, and grass/grain. As well as the Basic Set, the woman was tested for mould mushrooms, getting a positive result for Aspergillus fumigatus – equal to 3/4, and Penicillium notatutm receiving the same value. After analysis the connection between the interview and aeroallergen prick test results, the clinical vitality for allergens from every positive test was established (Table 2).
None of the positive tests indicated an allergen clinically significant for the woman. Apart from skin prick tests, bearing in mind the coexistence of eczema in the vicinity of haired head skin, cheeks, neck, and lobules of auricle, a patch test was performed using the European Basic Series. These tests are conducted by laying a few haptens on the skin (especially on the back) [14] for 48 h. It is read after 48 and 72 h. The most commonly used is the European Basic Series, which contains of 28 haptens. Sometimes, for diagnosis a histopathologic test is required [15]. The tests were read according to the procedure after 48 and 72 h. They rendered negative in the case of every tested allergen (hapten). Hence, she was diagnosed with eczema on the basis of irritation. Except from skin tests, the patient underwent spirometry several times with an aim to examine eventual ventilation disorders (Table 3).
The spirometry was, during most of the visits, performed because of allergic rhinitis and its eventual implication on asthma development. It draws attention to the fact that in any of the spirometries obturation or restriction traits were not indicated – all of these rendered correct. The patient also had the level of IL-33 in blood marked using an ELISA test. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test – immunoenzymatic test, is one of the most commonly used screening tests in biomedical research. It is used to indicate several proteins in the examined material using the antibodies coupled with a particular enzyme. Using this test she was diagnosed with elevated level of this cytokine (result: 120.33), comparing to healthy volunteers (100.65). The patient remains under many specialists’ care. She still has pains in her joints, but less intensively. She currently takes a second antibiotic, Ceftriaxone, with slight clinical correction.","Diagnosis:

Lyme Disease with Joint Involvement

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient tested positive for antibodies against *Borrelia burgdorferi*. These antibodies, combined with the reported joint pain, symptoms of rhinitis, and elevated IL-33 levels, suggest Lyme disease with joint involvement.

Suitable Treatments:
* Antibiotics: Currently receiving Ceftriaxone
* Consider prolonged antibiotic therapy as needed, including oral antibiotics like Doxycycline or Amoxicillin
* - Pain Management: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen for joint pain
* - Physical Therapy: To help manage joint pain and maintain joint function
* - Regular Monitoring: Follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment effectiveness"
"A 21-year-old male presented to the hospital with acute-onset swelling over the neck and submandibular area (Figure 1). A clinical diagnosis of Ludwig’s angina was made. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography neck revealed diffuse soft-tissue swelling involving bilateral sublingual and submandibular spaces; diffuse swelling of bilateral aryepiglottic folds causing narrowing of airway (Figure 2). Urgent tracheostomy was done as the patient developed stridor. Later, the case was seen by a physician. History revealed that the patient had taken one tablet of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, paracetamol 325 mg + ibuprofen 400 mg, and experienced onset of symptoms within 30 min. A diagnosis of anaphylactic shock was made.

Figure 2: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography neck revealed diffuse soft tissue swelling involving bilateral sublingual and submandibular spaces with fat stranding, diffuse swelling of bilateral aryepiglottic folds causing narrowing of the airway, and diffuse swelling of the soft palate.
He was put on invasive ventilation, vasopressor support in view of refractory hypotension, steroids, and other supportive measures. The patient was noticed to have dark color urine and reduced urine output. Serum creatinine (SCr) increased from 1.1 to 2.5 mg/dL on the same day, with serum potassium (6.1 meq/L). He was transferred thereafter to a subspecialty center. At this hospital, SCr was 4.5 mg/dL, serum potassium - 6.5 meq/L, serum lactate dehydrogenase - 2391 IU/L, and creatine phosphokinase - 18,000 U/L. Urine dipstick was positive for blood.

He was started on an intravenous fluid-diuretic and alkalinization of urine regime. However, in view of progressive oligoanuria, rising SCr with hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, he was initiated on hemodialysis (HD). He was weaned off invasive ventilation after three days, and tracheostomy was closed after one week. He received nine sessions of HD over 15 days, after which urine output improved and further HD were withheld. History was taken from the patient after recovery revealed no history of unaccustomed or severe exertion. He made a complete recovery and at follow-up after six months, he maintains normal renal function and muscle enzymes. The final diagnosis was anaphylaxis and AKI (rhabdomyolysis related). He was counseled against the use of ibuprofen for life.","Diagnosis:

Anaphylactic Shock

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The rapid onset of symptoms after ingestion of NSAID (30 minutes), presence of stridor, and respiratory distress along with hypotension are consistent with anaphylaxis. The need for urgent tracheostomy and vasopressor support further affirms the severity of the allergic reaction.

Suitable Treatments:
* Immediate discontinuation of the offending agent (NSAID in this case)
* Intravenous epinephrine (first line treatment)
* Corticosteroids (e.g, methylprednisolone) to mitigate inflammation and prevent late-phase reactions
* Antihistamines (e.g, diphenhydramine) for symptomatic relief
* Supportive care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors in case of hypotension
* Invasive ventilation as done in this case due to airway compromise
* Long-term management includes counseling and education regarding avoidance of NSAIDs and carrying an epinephrine auto-injector"
"A 40 years old male presented to the emergency with sudden onset of shortness of breath with pleuritic chest pain, and rashes which extended all over the body within minutes. He had history of abdominal discomfort and pain for one week. The pain increased in one day for which he was given intravenous diclofenac in local clinic 10 minutes prior to presentation at our center. He has no known allergy to drug or any other substances. He underwent polypectomy 2 month back for nasal polyp.

At the time of presentation, he was on severe respiratory distress with oxygen saturation 67% at room temperature, respiratory rate of 30/min, blood pressure 80/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 150 beats per minute, low in volume, regular, and normal in character, and body temperature of 37.7 ֩C. On auscultation of chest, he had diffused wheeze bilaterally. The serum tryptase level was increased and methylhistamine was found in his urine. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated D-dimer (3.6 mg/l) (Ref range:<250 ng/ml) and serum tryptase (25 ng/ml) (Ref range: 3–5 ng/ml). Methylhistamine level in the urinary sample taken about 4 hours later was 136 ng/μmol. Other laboratory investigations were within normal range.

Patient was stabilized with epinephrine, antihistamines, intravenous fluid, and oxygen therapy via facemask along with hydrocortisone 200mg three times a day (TDS). He was hospitalized and kept in intensive care unit (ICU) for 24 hours. He didnt develop biphasic or multiphasic anaphylactic episodic complications during the hospital stay. Following the recovery, the patient was discharged on antihistamine for one week. On follow-up after a week, he was improving and there were no fresh issues.","Diagnosis:

Kounis syndrome (KS)
* Probability: High
* Emergency: Immediate
* Rationale: Sudden onset of respiratory distress, low blood pressure, pleuritic chest pain, generalized rash, history of drug administration (diclofenac), increased serum tryptase and methylhistamine levels strongly indicate an anaphylactic reaction. Diclofenac, despite no known prior allergies, can cause such a life-threatening reaction.

Suitable Treatments:
* Immediate discontinuation of the offending agent (NSAID in this case)
* - Intravenous epinephrine (first line treatment)
* - Corticosteroids (e.g, methylprednisolone) to mitigate inflammation and prevent late-phase reactions
* Antihistamines (e.g, diphenhydramine) for symptomatic relief
* Supportive care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors in case of hypotension
* Invasive ventilation as done in this case due to airway compromise

"A 78-year-old man was admitted by ambulance with dyspnea 2 h after multiple bee stings. His medical history included diabetes and chronic renal failure but no history of any allergies or cardiac diseases. At the emergency room, he complained of dyspnea with wheezing and a generalized itchy rash. Two punctuated sting marks were observed on the back of his head and in his femoral region (Figure S1). On examination, his respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate were 22 breaths/min, 100% (with oxygen 10 L/min), 90/42 mmHg, and 86 bpm, respectively.

We diagnosed the patient with anaphylactic shock; he was immediately treated with an intramuscular injection of 0.5 mg of adrenaline, intravenous injections of H1 and H2antihistamine blockers, and steroids. Shortly after this treatment, his blood pressure increased to 116/43 mmHg, and symptoms of anaphylaxis disappeared. The first electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed no abnormality (Figure 1A), and echocardiography could not detect left ventricular asynergy immediately after the recovery of his vital signs. However, 10 min after the first ECG, he suddenly complained of chest oppression. ECG revealed ST elevation in the aVR lead and ST depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V2–V6 (Figure 1B). Echocardiography showed severe hypokinesis in the anteroseptal wall. We diagnosed the patient with KS and administered nicorandil via a continuous intravenous infusion for coronary artery spasms. This treatment immediately relieved his chest pain and improved the ST shift on ECG (Figure 1C). On blood examination, the patients troponin I level was 12.9 pg/mL (reference range: 0–25.2 pg/mL), and his creatinine kinase MB (CK-MB) level was 6 U/dL (reference range: 0–14 U/dL). Blood examination at 1 h after nicorandil administration also revealed no leakage of cardiac enzymes (troponin I = 11.4 U/dL, CK-MB <5 IU/dL; Table 1). Echocardiography indicated no abnormal wall motion. The unchanged cardiac enzyme levels and the history of chronic renal failure prevented our decision on emergent coronary angiography (CAG).

At 23 h after the bee stings, the patient suddenly complained of chest pain with hypotension, and ECG revealed ST elevation in the aVR lead and ST depression in the II, III, aVF, and V2–V6 leads (Figure 1D). Blood examination disclosed increases in his troponin I (4,698.9 IU/dL) and CK-MB levels (20 U/dL; Table 1), and emergent CAG was performed. A coronary angiogram uncovered 99% stenosis at the middle left anterior descending artery (Figure 2A), and intravascular ultrasound revealed vulnerable attenuated plaques at the lesion (Figure 2B). Two drug-eluting stents were deployed at the lesion (Figure 2C). After the percutaneous coronary intervention, his heart failure and renal failure contributed to bilateral lung congestion on chest X-ray (Figure 2D and Figure S2). He was managed in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and treatment with diuretic drugs, coronary vasodilators, and vasopressors. Finally, he was discharged on foot 19 days after arriving at our hospital.

"70-year-old man visited the local hospital in April 2019 for unexplained fatigue and cough. He had no chest tightness, shortness of breath, chest pain, heart palpitations, skin or sclera jaundice, anorexia, abdominal distension, vomiting of blood, or black stools. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells (WBCs) 4.24×109/L, hemoglobin 115 g/L,platelets 53×109/L, total bilirubin 36.7 µmol/L, albumin 32.9 g/L, alanine aminotransferase 31 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 51 U/L, and prothrombin time (PT) 14.9 s. Computed tomography (CT) showed liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly. His symptoms improved after liver-supporting and jaundice-reducing care. On May 15, 2019, the patient was admitted to the Department of Infectious diseases at our hospital for “liver cirrhosis; grade 3 hypertension; pulmonary infection”. He had a history of hepatitis E with successful treatment and a history of chronic hypertension. In April 2019, he was considered to have type 2 diabetes as laboratory tests performed at the local hospital showed elevated blood glucose. He had no known history of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, hepatic distomiasis, or schistosomiasis; chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease or kidney disease; blood transfusion or blood transfusion reactions; major trauma and surgery; or allergies to food or drugs. A physical examination performed at admission showed that he was consciousness and able to appropriately respond to questions, with normal orientation and numeration ability. He had no pale or yellow complexion. Additional exams showed palmar erythema (+), spider nevi (-), chest telangiectasias (+), no yellow skin, no skin ecchymosis or hyperpigmentation, no sclera jaundice, no bulbar conjunctiva edema, no pale eyelid conjunctiva, normal heart and lungs, smooth abdomen, no visible abdominal veins, normal umbilicus, soft abdominal muscles, tenderness (-), rebound tenderness (-), no palpable mass, Murphy’s sign (-), liver not palpable below the right costal arch, spleen not palpable below the left costal arch, percussion tenderness over the liver area (-), shifting dullness (-), normal bowel sounds, no pitting edema in the lower limbs, and flapping tremor (-). Laboratory tests showed WBC 2.25×109/L, hemoglobin 114 g/L, platelets 55×109/L, total bilirubin 36.7 µmol/L, albumin 32.9 g/L, alanine aminotransferase 37 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 71 U/L, PT 13.8 s, glycosylated hemoglobin 5.2%, creatinine 64 µmol/L, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (-), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) (+), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (-), hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe) (+), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) (+). After admission, the patient received symptomatic and supportive care, including liver-supporting therapy, albumin infusion, cough-reducing medicine and expectorant, and hypotensive drugs. The cause of liver cirrhosis was unknown, and bile duct disease was considered. Therefore, the patient was scheduled to undergo upper abdomen MRI and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to rule out bile duct conditions. On the afternoon of May 27, 2019, the patient went to the Department of Radiology for plain and enhanced upper abdomen MRI and MRCP. Before the MRI, the patient took oral gadobenate dimeglumine solution (3 mL diluted in 500 mL of normal saline) and received an intramuscular injection of anisodamine (10 mg). The MRI started at 7:00 pm. At 7:35 pm, 5.8 mL of gadobenate dimeglumine solution (Multihance, lot: 1810005B, Shanghai Bracco Sine Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China) and 20 mL of sodium chloride solution were bolus injected (iv) via a high-pressure injector. A few minutes later, the patient felt unwell during the two-phase dynamic enhanced scan. The physician immediately entered the exam room to communicate with the patient. The patient complained of nausea and was uncooperative. The scan was terminated. With the assistance of staff, the patient walked to the entrance of the scan room and then suddenly lost consciousness and was unresponsive. Gadobenate dimeglumine-induced anaphylactic shock was diagnosed based on the temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and the injection. The medical staff immediately established vein access for rehydration and volume expansion and administered oxygen therapy. In addition, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was promptly performed due to the loss of major arterial pulse and respiration, and drugs including epinephrine 1 mg, dexamethasone 5 mg, and methylprednisolone 80 mg were intravenously injected. At 7:48 pm, the patient’s blood pressure was 105/41 mmHg, and his pulse was 125 bpm. The emergency department was contacted for help. Upon arrival, the emergency physician found the patient lying supine on the floor, with a blue or purple complexion, no responsiveness, and no carotid arterial pulse. Chest compression and balloon-assisted ventilation continued. The patient’s heart sounds resumed, and he was transferred to the emergency room for further treatment. Cardiac arrest recurred during transfer, and rescue therapy, including chest compressions and balloon-assisted ventilation, was readministered. In the emergency room, the patient continued to receive chest compressions and balloon-assisted ventilation in addition to rehydration and volume expansion [compound ammonium chloride injection (500 mL, iv), 5% glucose injection (500 mL, iv)] and vasoactive drugs [norepinephrine (18 mg, bolus) + dopamine (180 mg, bolus)] to maintain blood pressure. An anesthesiologist was consulted and performed emergency endotracheal intubation, and the patient was connected on a ventilator. Additionally, a cardiologist was consulted and performed emergency placement of a temporary pacemaker. Despite active treatments, the patient remained unconscious. Norepinephrine (18 mg, iv) and dopamine (180 mg, iv) were administered to maintain blood pressure. Physical examination showed blood pressure 90/45 mmHg and heart rate 103 bpm. Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 100% with ventilator-assisted ventilation. The pupils were round and of equal size (approximately 6 mm), with no light reflex. The carotid arterial pulse was palpable. The family was notified of the patient’s critical condition and adverse prognosis. The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for further treatment. Unfortunately, he underwent brain death on May 31 and clinical death on June 11 due to his rapidly progressing and uncontrolled conditions. ","Diagnosis:

Gadobenate Dimeglumine-Induced Anaphylactic Shock

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: Extremely High
* Rationale: Symptoms started immediately after injection of gadobenate dimeglumine, consistent with anaphylactic shock. Rapid onset of nausea, unresponsiveness, loss of major arterial pulse, and cardiac arrest.

Suitable Treatments:
* Intravenous epinephrine (1 mg), intravenous methylprednisolone (80 mg), rehydration, oxygen therapy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, and ventilator support"
"65-year-old female was admitted to our hospital in February 2023 due to “persistent headache for six months” and CTA revealed multiple intracranial aneurysms. Subsequently, a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed to identify an aneurysm at the terminal bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery (M1 segment), left posterior communicating artery aneurysm, left ophthalmic artery aneurysm, right posterior communicating artery aneurysm, and right ophthalmic artery aneurysm. During the injection of Iohexol, a rash appeared on the skin, which quickly resolved with antiallergic treatment. The patient reported no discomfort upon discharge. In April 2023, the patient returned for treatment of the right posterior communicating artery aneurysm and ophthalmic artery aneurysm. And no hypersensitivity reaction occurred with iodixanol injection during the operation. A month ago, she was readmitted for reexamination of the embolization status of the aneurysms.

During the cerebral angiography procedure, approximately 25 mL of iodixanol (Yangtze River pharmaceutical group, Batch No: 23070461) was injected through a 5F Pigtail catheter for angiography of aortic arch. After completing the aortic arch angiography, a 5F VER 135° single-curve catheter was used for cervical-vertebral angiography. Approximately 3 mins after the injection of iodixanol into the ascending aorta through the 5F single-curve catheter via the femoral artery sheath, the patient experienced dizziness, increased heart rate (HR 120 bpm), followed by hypotension (BP 90/43 mm Hg), a sudden drop-in heart rate (HR 68 bpm), and SpO2 decreased to 92%. Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) was immediately administered for antiallergic treatment, oxygen therapy via a mask for oxygen-inhalation, accelerated fluid infusion and other anti-shock treatment measures. However, the patient subsequently experienced tics of the limbs, foaming in the mouth and unresponsiveness, emergency administration of intravenous diazepam (5 mg) for sedation, and aspiration of sputum to maintain airway patency. At this point, the blood pressure continued to drop to 53/29 mm Hg, and no SpO2 reading was detected. Intravenous drip saline was accelerated, and dopamine 20 mg was administered to increase the blood pressure. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were initiated to assist breathing. After ~3 mins, no blood pressure readings were obtained, and intermittent intravenous boluses of epinephrine (1 mg) were administered immediately to raise the blood pressure (total of 4 mg). The blood pressure gradually recovered to 126/90 mm Hg, and SpO2 gradually increased to 95%. However, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, bilateral dilated pupils with a diameter of approximately 5 mm, no light responsiveness, and no reaction to painful stimuli was observed. The patient was urgently transferred to the NICU for further monitoring and treatment.

The patient remained in a deep coma state with bilateral fixed dilated pupils measuring approximately 5 mm. Spontaneous breathing was not observed, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated to actively revive the patient’s heartbeat. However, there was still no spontaneous breathing observed (the concentration of K+ dropped to 2.8 mol/L). After continuing with antiallergic, anti-shock, and correction of internal environmental disturbances, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further treatment.

After being transfer to the ICU, the patient remained in a deep coma state with bilateral dilated pupils measuring approximately 3.5 mm. She had a delayed response to light reflex and shallow breathing. The patient was supported with ventilator (FiO2, 90%) to maintain SpO2 above 90%. Blood pressure and heart rate were relatively stable after intravenous of norepinephrine (10 mg) and epinephrine (2 mg), with HR was 102 bpm and BP was 108/63 mm Hg. Continuous mild hypothermic brain protection therapy was administered. The patient experienced extensive subcutaneous bleeding in the lower limbs, coarse breath sounds in the lungs, dull heart sounds in the apex, absent bowel sounds, low muscle tone in the limbs, and no lower limb edema. Analysis of arterial gas indicated: pH 7.38, PCO2 20.63 mmHg, PO286.71 mmHg, K+ 5.04 mmol/L, Na+ 155 mmol/L, Ca2+ 0.84 mmol/L, Lac 17.60 mmol/L. Coagulation tests showed: INR 1.75, PT 19.40 s, Fbg 0.78 g/L, TT 87.60 s, APTT 55.90 s (Key values of coagulation tests can be found in Figure 1). The patient had abnormal coagulation function and received plasma to correct coagulation, the posterior pituitary (36U/50 mL) and carbazochrome sodium sulfonate (80 mg/250 mL) for hemostasis, omeprazole (80 mg/250 mL) to suppress acid, antiallergic and anti-shock treatment, and correction of internal environment disturbances. Laboratory evaluations revealed the white blood cell count of 19.01×10^9/L, with 94.9% being neutrophils, and TNT-HSST was 2210.00 ng/L (Changes in white blood cells and neutrophil percentages can be found in Figure 2). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were 317 U/L (normal 7~40 U/L), 562 U/L (normal 13~35 U/L), and 1788 U/L (normal 109~245 U/L), respectively. IL-6 was 9168.38 pg/mL and procalcitonin (PCT) level was 49.71 ng/mL, prompting timely continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Afterwards, the patient’s condition deteriorated further (PH 6.9, K+ 6.72 mmol/L, AST 953 U/L, ALT 1580 U/L, SCR 350 μmol/L), with loss of light reflex and no response to painful stimuli in the limbs. And the patient’s severe metabolic acidosis, persistent hyperlactacidemia, and severe internal environmental disturbances could not be corrected, leading to continuous deterioration (key indicators of blood gas analysis, electrolyte levels, and liver and kidney function tests are shown in Figure 3). Finally, the patient was declared dead due to rescue invalid as a result of anaphylactic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple organ dysfunction.

Anaphylactic shock due to iodinated contrast media

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient experienced sudden onset of dizziness, tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation within minutes of iodixanol injection, followed by limb tics, foaming at the mouth, and unresponsiveness. These symptoms are consistent with a severe anaphylactic reaction.

Suitable Treatments:
* Immediate discontinuation of the offending agent (iodixanol)
* Epinephrine administration (intramuscular or intravenous)
* Oxygen therapy and airway management (endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation)
* Intravenous fluids and vasopressors (dopamine, norepinephrine) to maintain blood pressure
* Antihistamines and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and allergic response"
"A 66-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital under the medical team for investigation of recent unexplained weight loss of approximately one stone in 6 months. He has a background of rheumatoid arthritis for the past 30 years. He was on hemodialysis for end stage renal failure. Other comorbidities included hypertension and coronary artery disease. Patient had severe bilateral arthritis of both knees that was being treated conservatively by the rheumatologist. As a part of his conservative management, the patient received bilateral knee intraarticular corticosteroid injections. A combination of 80 mg of methylprednisolone and 8 ml of 1% lignocaine was injected into each knee under aseptic precautions. After 6 days, the patient complained of severe bilateral knee pain and was unable to weight bear. Slightest movement of knee aggravated the pain. Patient also complained of chills and rigors with intermittent fever. After 2 days, his both knees were aspirated revealing purulent fluid, which was sent to microbiology for culture and sensitivity. He was referred to the orthopedic service for review.

On examination, he was febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C and tachycardic. Patient was unable to weight bear. Examination of both knees revealed local increased temperature, tenderness on palpation of the patello-femoral joint, medial and lateral joint line. A large effusion was noted in both knees; left knee more than the right with a painful decreased range of movements in both knees. The inflammatory markers were raised with a white cell count of 35.19 × 109/L, neutrophil count of 33.27 × 109/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 159 mm at the end of 1 h and C-reactive protein 465. Antero-posterior view [Figure 1] and lateral views [Figures ​[Figures22and ​and3]3] of bilateral knee radiographs showed advance osteoarthritis in both knees with large effusions. History, clinical examination and laboratory findings were highly suggestive of simultaneous bilateral septic arthritis of the knees secondary to intraarticular steroid injections. Patient was taken to the operating theatre for arthroscopic washout and debridement of both knees. 270 ml of frank pus was drained from left knee while 120 ml drained from right knee. A thorough debridement was performed and both knee joints were washed out with 6 L of normal saline. The fluid from both knees and tissue samples taken were sent for culture and sensitivity. Patient was commenced empirically on intravenous flucloxacillin 2 g 4 times daily and fucidic acid 500 mg twice-a-day. Culture and sensitivity revealed Staphylococcus aureus, which was sensitive to flucloxacillin. Antibiotics were continued for 6 weeks. Arthroscopic washout and debridement was repeated twice subsequently. 6 weeks post-operatively white cell count and inflammatory markers had normalized and articular symptoms had resolved. Patient has given the consent for this case report to be published.

Septic arthritis of bilateral knees

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient developed severe bilateral knee pain, inability to bear weight, fever, and chills after receiving intraarticular corticosteroid injections. Purulent fluid was aspirated from both knees, and the inflammatory markers were significantly elevated. These findings are highly suggestive of septic arthritis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Surgical Interventions:
* Immediate arthroscopic washout and debridement to remove infected material
* Repeated as necessary based on clinical response."
"a healthy 27-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history, who was seen by his primary care physician (PCP) roughly 10 days prior to arrival to our tertiary care centre for symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis. He was instructed to maintain hydration, and returned to his PCPs office 1 week later as his symptoms had not improved. Laboratory evaluation noted a serum creatinine of 8.8. He was air evacuated from his rural setting to our tertiary care centre. He was admitted to the general medicine floor where he was treated symptomatically over the weekend while awaiting a kidney biopsy on the following Monday. On the third hospital night, during routine vital signs check, the patient developed severe acute respiratory distress with oxygen desaturation to mid-70s on room air. He was placed on a 15 L non-rebreather mask with improvement in his oxygen saturations only to the mid-80s. His respiratory status declined through the night requiring ICU admission, intubation and mechanical ventilation. He was stabilised and presumptively started on treatment for a pulmonary renal syndrome which included high-dose intravenous steroids and ventilatory support.

An extensive workup for the aetiology of his initial acute renal failure, and subsequent respiratory failure. He only had a positive lupus anticoagulant antibody. Cardiolipin, glomerular basement membrane, proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, ribonucleoprotein, DsDNA, chromatin, ribosomal P, SM, Ro/SSA, La/SSB, centromere B, Scl70, Jo antibodies, antinuclear antibodies were all negative. C reactive protein was elevated at 50 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 26 as expected given the patients acute inflammatory response secondary to injury. C3, C4 were within normal limits. B2 glycoprotein IgA, IgG and IgM were negative. Fungal, sputum and acid-fast bacilli cultures were negative. Urine drug screen was negative for barbiturates, methylphenidates, benzodiazepines, tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, amphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants and phencyclidine. The patient was negative for hepatitis B testing. Kidney biopsy showed non-specific mesangiopathic glomerular changes, and the pathology report could not rule out postinfectious glomerulonephritis with minimal tubulointerstitial disease. The kidney biopsy was negative for vasculitis, sclerosis and crescents. Electron microscopy of the biopsy showed mild fibrosis with mild interstitial oedema. On having negative laboratory evidence of common vasculitis, and a relatively unremarkable kidney biopsy, a thoracotomy with wedge resection lung biopsy was performed. Lung biopsy showed acute alveolar haemorrhage with focal capillaritis, macrophages and erythematous changes without evidence of vasculitis. His CT chest was not consistent with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. He was diagnosed with pulmonary capillaritis.","Diagnosis:

Pulmonary capillaritis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High. Pulmonary capillaritis can lead to life-threatening respiratory failure.
* Rationale: The lung biopsy showed acute alveolar hemorrhage with focal capillaritis, which is consistent with pulmonary capillaritis. The patients severe acute respiratory distress and oxygen desaturation support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* The patient was started on methylprednisolone 1 g intravenous daily with quick improvement in his clinical condition
* He was successfully extubated approximately 48 h of steroid therapy
* Respiratory and renal function improved with steroids
* The patient was discharged from the hospital 1 week after his period of respiratory failure with normal kidney function
* He eventually returned to Alaska with close follow-up with his primary care provider and pulmonologist
* The patient was discharged from the hospital 1 week after his period of respiratory failure with normal kidney function and respiratory status
* He underwent a slow corticosteroid taper and had complete resolution of symptoms"
"A 39-year-old male was admitted for work-up of occult infection due to recurrent fevers, nausea, nonbilious emesis, and occipital headache for three weeks. Prior history was notable for traumatic brain injury in 1995 complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage with subsequent placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.

At presentation, the patient was tachycardic (HR: 130 per minute) and febrile (103 F) with urticarial plaques involving trunk, arms, and legs. Initial laboratory studies were notable for serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, C3 of 45 mg/dL (normal: 98–162), C4 of 9 mg/dL (normal: 16–43), and rheumatoid factor > 100 international units/mL (normal: <15). Urine microscopy did not reveal dysmorphic red cells or cellular casts. Cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated protein, decreased glucose, and gram stain with moderate leukocytosis but no organisms. Brain computed tomography indicated stable findings of his prior surgeries. The patient was given intravenous vancomycin. During the admission, a 24-hour urine collection revealed 1.4 grams of protein. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures remained negative for growth. However, serum creatinine only improved to 1.6 mg/dL (baseline: 0.98–1.1 mg/dL), so a renal biopsy was performed. Following the biopsy, the patients renal insufficiency began improving, and this recovery was thought to be secondary to successful treatment of the infection. Vancomycin was discontinued at this time in light of negative blood cultures and the consultant neurosurgeon did not feel shunt removal was necessary at that time.

With regard to the renal biopsy, the glomeruli showed mesangial hypercellularity and segmental endocapillary proliferation with a single glomerular crescent containing hyaline droplets. Another glomerulus showed a sclerotic segment. There was no evidence of tubular cell vacuoles. The glomerular basement membranes were not thickened. Immunofluorescence was done with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies against human IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, fibrin, kappa light chain, and lambda light chain, using appropriate controls. A total of four glomeruli were identified. The glomeruli showed focal segmental 2+ IgM and 3+ C3 mesangial staining in three of the glomeruli. The glomeruli were negative for the other stains. The tubular basement membranes were negative for all of the aforementioned stains.

Electron microscopy showed that the foot processes of the podocytes were subtotally effaced. Rare, small, subendothelial osmiophilic electron-dense deposits were identified. Subepithelial deposits were not present. Spikes or duplicated basement membranes were not identified. Segmentally, there were increased numbers of endothelial and mononuclear cells. The mesangial matrix was mildly expanded and there was slightly increased mesangial cellularity with a few osmiophilic electron-dense deposits identified in the mesangium. These electron-dense deposits were not identified in the tubular basement membranes. The final biopsy reports diagnosis was acute interstitial nephritis with tubular epithelial necrosis and segmental endocapillary proliferation with increased mesangial hypercellularity.

Two months after the renal biopsy, the patient was readmitted for recurrent symptoms similar to his initial presentation. Vital signs and exam were unremarkable. Laboratory data on readmission were notable for serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, C3 of 63 mg/dL, C4 of 15 mg/dL, and rheumatoid factor > 100 international units/mL. Cranial imaging did not show acute findings. On subsequent hospital day, the patient had repeat cerebrospinal fluid studies which showed the presence of Gram-positive organisms. He was restarted on antibiotics and the VP shunt was removed emergently. Cerebrospinal fluid culture resulted in the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and shunt hardware culture grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. As per infectious disease consultants recommendations, the patient was treated with two weeks of intravenous vancomycin and ampicillin. Repeat blood cultures were negative and no further antimicrobial treatment was required.

At 1-month follow-up in the clinic, the patient had persistent skin lesions; he was otherwise asymptomatic with no headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills. Microscopic hematuria had completely resolved, C3 had increased to near normal levels, and serum creatinine had improved but not to baseline. Mild proteinuria persisted. Rheumatoid factor was normal. Serum creatinine was 1.2 and hemoglobin was 11.2 g/dL.","Diagnosis:

Infection involving VP shunt

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of recurrent fevers, headache, and detection of Gram-positive organisms in cerebrospinal fluid, as well as culture of shunt hardware growing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium acnes point towards a VP shunt infection.

Suitable Treatments:
* antibiotic therapy and shunt removal"
"70-year-old male with a terminal jejunostomy presented at the outpatient clinic with dyspnoea and fatigue since 6 weeks. The patient was completely depending on parenteral feeding through a VSM shunt after the patient had a haemicolectomy and intestinal ischaemia due to colorectal cancer. This shunt was installed as a sustainable solution for the lifelong use of parental nutrition (Figure 1).


Figure 1X-ray from the procedure when the vena saphena magna shunt was first installed in 2009.

He also had hypertension, chronic hepatitis B infection, and microcytic anaemia. However, prior to the current event, the patient’s general condition was good, and he lived independently.

Physical examination demonstrated rales on chest auscultation and peripheral oedema. His blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, and heart rate was 76 b.p.m. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation (AF) with a heart rate between 70 and 100 b.p.m. on repeated ECGs. Laboratory testing revealed NT-proBNP of 315 pmol/L. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the hospital for decongestion with intravenous loop diuretics.

Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a reduced LVEF of 35% along with dilated atria and left ventricle (LVEDd 5.6 cm). Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease. Right heart catheterization was performed after complete decongestion. Cardiac output (CO) measured by thermodilution using a Swan-Ganz catheter was elevated (at rest CO 7.2 L/min; cardiac index 3.63 L/min/m2).2 There was no pulmonary hypertension (PA mean 15 mmHg), capillary wedge pressure was normal (mean 8 mmHg), mean arterial pressure was 25 mmHg, mean right atrial pressure was 4 mmHg, and systemic vascular resistance was 856 dyn*s*/cm5. At this time, NT-proBNP levels had decreased to 25 pmol/L. Cardiac biopsy revealed subendocardial fibrosis without evidence of myocarditis, storage disease, or metabolic disease. Blood testing did not indicate the presence of autoimmune disorders or deficiencies in micronutrient or vitamins [selenium 1.35 µmol/L (normal range 0.8–1.41), vitamin B1 222 nmol/L (100–230), vitamin B6 378 nmol/L (50–200), vitamin B12 721 pmol/L (02-2019) (145–569), vitamin D 43 pmol/L (59–159), and vitamin C 50.2 µmol/L (26–88)].

Captopril was initiated at a dosage of 6.25 mg three times daily (TID), which was subsequently increased to 12.5 mg TID. The medication was crushed and administered sublingually. Blood pressure lowered to 108/60 mmHg, strongly suggesting that captopril was taken up. Rectal administration of metoprolol at a low dose did not elicit any effect on heart rate. Metoprolol was stopped after several days as heart rate remained in an acceptable range and effects of beta-blockade to improve outcome are limited in AF if at all present.3 Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed sublingual captopril, dalteparin (subcutaneous anticoagulation), and parenteral feeding.

After 2 weeks, sublingual captopril was discontinued due to symptomatic hypotension. In a multidisciplinary meeting involving vascular surgery, the decision was made to postpone shunt adjustment to avoid the risk of thrombosis formation and potential loss of the shunt, which could have endangered the patient’s life. Since AF can lead to a reduction in LVEF even in the absence of tachycardia, elective electric cardioversion was performed. Despite of constant sinus rhythm for several weeks, echocardiography revealed no improvement in LVEF. Therefore, it was decided to reduce the flow of the shunt. The patient underwent this procedure 4 months later, during which the stunt was successfully reduced. Parenteral feeding through this shunt was continued. Close monitoring of the patient was continued at the HF outpatient clinic. Echocardiography 4 months after reduction of the shunt revealed normalization of LVEF to 54%, LVEDd 4.6 cm, and the patient was free of any signs or symptoms of HF .","Diagnosis:

High-Output Heart Failure

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presents with dyspnoea and fatigue, a reduced LVEF of 35%, dilated atria and left ventricle, elevated cardiac output (7.2 L/min) with a normal wedge pressure, and an initially high NT-proBNP level—all indicative of high-output heart failure, likely aggravated by the parenteral feeding shunt.

Suitable Treatments:
* Initial Treatment: Intravenous loop diuretics for decongestion
* - Long-Term Management:
     - Medication: ACE inhibitors like captopril, though adjusted due to symptomatic hypotension
* - Procedures: Reduction of the parenteral feeding shunt to lower cardiac output
* - Monitoring: Regular follow-up via echocardiography and NT-proBNP levels"
"A 32-year-old male migrant worker from St Lucia presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of myalgias, headache and fever. He was previously healthy. He was visiting Canada temporarily and had arrived in Canada 11 days before his presentation. One day after arriving in Canada, he ate commercially prepared hamburger patties, which he reported as “off-tasting”. Five days later, he became fatigued and experienced a bilateral, intermittent headache associated with photophobia and visual aura. He noticed that his eyes were bloodshot. Three days later, he developed loose, nonwatery, non-bloody diarrhea, associated with fever and rigors, which resolved completely in two days. At presentation, he complained of lethargy, lower-extremity myalgias, tea-coloured urine and intermittent epigastric discomfort. On examination, his temperature was 37.2°C, heart rate 87 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min and blood pressure 113/72 mmHg. He had scleral icterus with conjunctival edema (Figure 1). He had no hepatosplenomegaly. His leukocyte count was 19.9×109/L, hemoglobin level 124 g/L and platelet count 24×109/L. His electrolyte levels, bicarbonate levels and anion gap were within normal limits; however, his creatinine level was 352 μmol/L and urea level was 18 mmol/L. His aspartate aminotransferase level was 310 U/L, alanine transaminase level 175 U/L, alkaline phosphatase level 79 U/L and total bilirubin level 191 μmol/L. His initial creatine kinase level was 2343 U/L and troponin I level was 1.6 μg/L. An initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and an incomplete right bundle branch block.

Photograph of the eyes of a 32-year-old man who presented with myalgias, headache and subjective fever. Scleral icterus with conjunctival edema is evident. His total bilirubin level was 256 μmol/L when this photograph was taken


He was admitted with an initial, presumptive diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and received two units of fresh frozen plasma. A hemolysis work-up returned negative: serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 353 U/L, haptoglobin level 2.9 g/L, total bilirubin level 191 μmol/L, indirect bilirubin level 60 μmol/L and direct bilirubin level 131 μmol/L. On a blood film, fragments were only rarely observed. Abdominal ultra-sonography revealed hepatic periportal echogenicity, diffuse renal cortical echogenicity and no hydronephrosis. Echocardiography showed mild concentric left ventricular wall thickening and no regional wall motion abnormalities, with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (54%). Furthermore, serology for cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV were negative. Blood films failed to show intraerythrocytic trophozoites. Blood cultures were negative. Stool culture for Escherichia coliO157:H7 was also negative.

He remained clinically stable and had good urine output with improving kidney function. However, his leukocyte count increased to 37.6×109/L and his direct bilirubin level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased to 169 μmol/L and 110 mm/h, respectively, suggesting progression of his hepatopathy and ongoing systemic inflammation.

A diagnostic test was performed.

Leptospirosis serology was ordered.","Diagnosis:

Leptospirosis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira, can present with many of the symptoms and signs described: myalgias, headache, fever, conjunctival suffusion (edema), rash, jaundice, renal impairment, and elevated liver enzymes. Given the patients exposure history, including eating ""off-tasting"" hamburger patties, and his travel history, leptospirosis should be strongly considered.

Suitable Treatments:
* Antibiotics: Intravenous penicillin G (preferred) or ceftriaxone
* - Supportive Care: Hydration and management of renal and hepatic dysfunction
* - Monitoring: Regular monitoring of renal function, liver enzymes, and complete blood count"
"43-year-old male chainsaw operator from the municipality of Atalaia do Norte, Amazonas, Brazil, presented with a three-day history of fever, chills, headache, and myalgia, and sought medical care at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado in Manaus, Amazonas. A thick blood smear test was done to investigate Plasmodium sp. infection but showed positivity for T. cruziinstead, and hospital admission was requested. On admission, the patient presented pain on deep palpation of the epigastrium and the liver was palpable at 4 cm from the rib cage but was non-tender. His heart rate was 60 bpm.

One day after admission, the patient presented oliguria and altered renal function examination, with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min and creatine phosphokinase level of 1726 U/L. The creatinine clearance increased to 48 mL/min two days after the initial measurement. The results of the hepatic and renal biomarkers, as well as other biochemical parameters are presented in Table 1.

Acute Chagas Disease

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patient presented with symptoms of fever, chills, myalgia, and headache, which are consistent with the acute phase of Chagas disease. The thick blood smear test confirmed the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi. Additional symptoms such as hepatomegaly, oliguria, and altered renal function, coupled with myocardial involvement (acute myocarditis) confirmed by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI findings, strongly support this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Treatment with benznidazole (Rochagan®) 5-7 mg/kg for 60 days was initiated following the guidelines of the 2nd Brazilian Consensus on CD7
* After the fifth day of hospitalization, and the third day of treatment, there was an improvement in symptoms, but with a persistent positivity in the thick blood smear
* New examinations were performed fifteen days after admission in which the thick blood smear showed negative results
* Three months later, in the outpatient follow-up, cardiac examinations were repeated and showed normal findings, the transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70%, and laboratory examination confirmed the complete normalization of the glomerular filtration rate"
"A 30-year-old man with no prior medical history was referred to the Department of Cardiology at our hospital for further investigation and treatment of bicuspid aortic valve and aortic regurgitation with left ventricular enlargement. The patient was deemed a suitable candidate for surgery and was referred to the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery for further management. Informed consent was obtained for surgery and POM and the patient visited his family dentist for the procedure. Oral care, involving invasive dental procedures, was performed without prior administration of antimicrobials. The patient developed a low-grade fever a few days after POM, without any specific symptoms, for which he did not seek medical help. The patient underwent autologous blood transfusion eight days after POM because he had not developed any other symptoms except for the low-grade fever. At that time, transthoracic echocardiography revealed no evidence of decreased cardiac function or presence of vegetations. He was admitted for surgery 10 days after POM. He did not have a fever, but blood tests showed acute inflammation; therefore, the surgery was postponed and a systemic examination was performed. A whole-body computed tomography scan showed no obvious abnormalities; therefore, treatment with antimicrobial agents was started. On the fourth day of hospitalization, Streptococcus mutans was detected in all blood cultures taken at the time of hospitalization, and transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral regurgitation with vegetations, which had not been observed before (Figure ​(Figure11).

Transesophageal echocardiography findings revealed mitral regurgitation with vegetations (arrow), which had not been observed before.
These findings led to a definitive diagnosis of IE according to the modified Duke criteria [5]. Therefore, he was referred to our department for the investigation of the cause and evaluation of the oral condition.

The patient had good oral hygiene, and there was no evidence of deep caries and tooth mobility that could cause hematogenous infection. The occlusal surface of the third molar of the right mandible was stained, but the patient did not report any accompanying symptoms (Figure ​(Figure22).

Infective Endocarditis

* Probability: Very High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of Streptococcus mutans in blood cultures, vegetations observed in transesophageal echocardiography, and the history of recent invasive dental procedures are strong indicators of IE.

Suitable Treatments:
* After consultation with the attending physician, it was decided that the suspected source of infection should be immediately treated, and the patient underwent extraction of the third molar and treatment for caries of the second molar of the right mandible
* The postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up was completed after good healing was confirmed
* The patient then underwent valve replacement and valvuloplasty and the postoperative course was good"
"An 81-year-old Middle Eastern male patient with unremarkable medical family history and with DM, hypertension, and multinodular goiter as past medical history was admitted to our hospital three times over a period of 2 months for fever and cough (Table 1). His complaints started with an acute onset fever reaching 39 °C and a dry cough after 3 weeks of the second Pfizer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine dose. His symptoms were initially attributed to the vaccine. Later he was started on an oral course of levofloxacin, but he did not respond. He was admitted to our medical center for further management.

During the first hospital admission, the computed tomography (CT)-chest findings of the patient were consistent with multilobar pneumonia. He received a course of piperacillin-tazobactam for 7 days and was discharged home off antibiotics after he showed marked improvement in symptoms and laboratory results. After 2 weeks of discharge from the hospital, the patient was readmitted to our medical center for dry cough and chills. There was no documented fever. He took 3 days of oral (PO) levofloxacin at home. The CT-chest showed new ground glass opacities at the right lower lobe, so he was treated with 1 week of cefepime as a case of hospital-acquired pneumonia with the recent intake of piperacillin-tazobactam.

To note that during these two admissions, he had marked improvement in his respiratory symptoms as well as his laboratory findings. For example, the procalcitonin level in the first hospital admission was 10.4 ng/ml on the first day, it decreased to 1.18 ng/ml at the end of therapy, and it was 35 ng/ml at the first day during the second hospital admission where it then decreased to 0.16 ng/ml before discharge. Blood and urine cultures were negative, and he was discharged after being afebrile for 72 hours on both occasions.

Three weeks after the second hospital admission, the patient presented back to the emergency department (ED) with a high-grade fever, chills, and dry cough. On physical examination, he was found to have diffuse rhonchi on lung auscultation, while the remaining examination was unremarkable. CT-chest showed bilateral scattered lung nodules. He was started on meropenem to treat new hospital-acquired pneumonia. Three sets of blood cultures were taken, separated by more than 12 hours, and the three sets grew multisensitive Streptococcus oralis in five out of six bottles.

He was started on ceftriaxone according to the culture results and susceptibilities, including the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (Table 2). The repeated cultures after 48 hour were negative.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was done. It showed mild aortic valve regurgitation, mild mitral valve regurgitation, and pulmonic valve regurgitation, which was considered more severe compared with an old TTE result for the patient at our medical center. With the positive blood cultures for viridans group streptococci and the new valvular disease, we had two major clinical criteria for definite infective endocarditis. The patient refused any invasive procedure, so transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was not done. Instead, we did a positron emission tomography (PET)–CT scan to search for any vulvar vegetation; however, it was negative.

After ten days of receiving specific treatment with intravenous antibiotics, TTE was repeated to compare the valvular problems with the previous TTE that was done on admission and to decide if any surgical intervention was needed. It showed a mass measuring 14 × 9 mm consistent with pulmonic valve vegetation (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1

The patient’s diagnosis was right-sided pulmonic valve endocarditis due to Streptococcus oralis. No surgical intervention was needed. He received treatment with a high dose of ceftriaxone for 4 weeks.

An oral panoramic image was ordered to search for any dental problem causing secondary bacteremia. It showed a dental abscess that was managed by the dentist while he was on antibiotics. Repeated TTE after 1 month of treatment showed improvement in the pulmonic valve function and persistent vegetation.

"A 16-year-old male was admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, P. R. China, on June 30, 2014 with a history of fever, skin rash over hand and feet, headache, and weakness in lower limbs over the past 4 days. The patient also had intraoral and throat pain, and non-projectile vomiting 3 days prior to admission. Two days prior to admission, the patient developed drowsiness, startle, hand tremor, urinary incontinence, and progressive deterioration in consciousness. He reported recent contact with a HFMD. Medications were limited to recent use of over-the-counter analgesics. The patient’s body temperature was 36.8 °C, respiratory rate was 25/min, pulse rate 98 beats/min, and blood pressure was 124/76 mmHg. Vesicular lesions and ulcers were present in the oral mucosa, and macular and vesicular lesions were present on palms and soles.

The patient was drowsy and non-verbal, but was responding to painful stimuli. He showed left-sided facial paralysis. The left nasolabial fold was flat and there was drooping of the mouth to the left side. The pupils were equal in size (diameter: 4 mm) and the pupillary light reflex was bilaterally symmetrical. Neck resistance was normal. The left upper and lower limbs showed reduced muscle strength (grade III–IV). The muscle strength in right limb was normal. Abdominal reflex and cremasteric reflex were normal. Pathological reflexes (e.g., Babinski, Chaddock, Oppenheim, Gordon) were negative. The rest of the physical findings were unremarkable.

Results of blood test were as follows: White blood cell count, 10.82 × 109; neutrophils, 92%; C-reactive protein, 80 mg/L, and blood glucose, 7 mmol/L. Findings of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination were as follows: Total number of cells, 188 × 106/L; nucleated cells, 44 × 106/L; monocytes 37 × 106/L; multinucleated cells 7 × 106/L; protein, 0.65 g/L; glucose, 5.74 mmol/L, and chlorides, 120.4 mmol/L.

IgM levels were quantified using ELISA kit (Cat No. 20143400198, Wantai Biopharm Inc., China). The CSF and serum tested positive for IgM antibody to EV71, but negative for IgM antibodies against Enterovirus, Herpes simplex virus, Cossack virus, and measles virus. EV71 RNA, but not CVA16, was detected in the patient’s faeces by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Cat No. 20133400621, SANSURE Biotech Inc., China). All tests were performed in the clinical laboratory at the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, P. R. China. Eight hours after admission, the patient showed progressive loss of consciousness and was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). He was in a coma and exhibited shallow breathing (30–40 breaths per minute). Pupils were sluggishly responsive to light with mild anisocoria (OD = 3 mm and OS = 4 mm). The patient showed no response to painful stimuli, and thus the muscle strength was not detected. The status of abdominal, cremasteric, and pathological reflexes was identical to that at the time of hospital admission. Based on the above clinical symptoms, a diagnosis of severe HFMD with brain stem encephalitis was established by specialists in the Department of Neurology and the Department of Infectious diseases.

The patient was administered mannitol (5 mL/kg/dose, q4h) to reduce the intracranial pressure, ganglioside for neurological recovery, creatine phosphate sodium for providing heart muscle energy, methyl prednisolone for reducing inflammation and cerebral edema, and potassium sodium dehydroandroan drographolide succinate as antiviral therapy. The patient was also administered midazolam (5 mg) twice daily on days 1 and 2 after admission to prevent agitation. From day 2, the patient received gamma immunoglobulin therapy (25 g/day) for 2 days.

Head CT performed on day 3 following admission showed signs of pineal calcification; no other obvious abnormality was observed in other parts. The patient was unconscious and comatose during EEG examination performed on day 3. The results were indicative of diffuse encephalopathy with mixed delta and theta wave activity in the range of 1–4 Hz, which indicated abnormal brain function.

The patient showed improvement and was transferred back to the Department of Infectious Diseases on day 4 following admission, and the same treatment was continued, except for gamma immunoglobulin therapy. On day 5, the patient regained consciousness, but showed paroxysmal increase in muscle tension in the limbs (mainly on the right side).

Head MRI performed on day 9 was normal. The patient showed progressive improvement and was able to walk with an unsteady gait; he was discharged from the hospital on day 10 following admission.

Two weeks after discharge, the patient still walked with an unsteady gait, but showed full recovery 1 month after discharge (normal limb muscle strength and tone, movement, and intelligence).","Diagnosis:

Severe Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The presence of fever, skin rash over hands and feet, intraoral ulcers, and other systemic symptoms points to HFMD. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, positive IgM antibody to EV71, and EV71 RNA detected in feces confirm the diagnosis. The additional symptoms of neurological impairment such as drowsiness, startle, hand tremor, urinary incontinence, progressive deterioration in consciousness, facial paralysis, and comatose state with diffuse encephalopathy suggest severe CNS involvement, classifiable as brain stem encephalitis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG): 25 g/day for 2 days (modulates the immune response and potentially reduces the severity)
* - Mannitol: 5 mL/kg/dose, q4h (to reduce intracranial pressure)
* - Methylprednisolone: for reducing inflammation and cerebral edema
* - Ganglioside: for neurological recovery
* - Creatine Phosphate Sodium: to provide energy to heart muscles
* - Antivirals: Potassium sodium dehydroandroa drographolide succinate
* - Sedation: Midazolam 5 mg twice daily (for preventing agitation)"
"A 19-year-old male with no previous medical or drug intake history complained of fever, chills, abdominal pain, vomiting and dark urine. The detection of IgM antibodies against HAV in the serum of the patient confirmed the diagnosis of hepatitis A. Five days later, the patient presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure for 5 min accompanied by cyanosis. He could not be awakened and remained unconscious after the seizure ended. The vital signs were temperature: 37.5 °C, respiratory rate: 16/min, blood pressure: 110/60 mm Hg and pulse rate: 80/min.

On physical examination, the patient was unresponsive with partially dilated pupils that reacted sluggishly to light. The Glasgow coma score (GCS) was 9/15, head and neck examination revealed scleral icterus with no nuchal rigidity or focal neurologic signs. The deep tendon reflexes were normal with flexor plantar responses bilaterally. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly were detected. Otherwise, no apparent infectious source was found except the recent HAV. Blood tests revealed white blood cell (WBC) counts of 6180 cells/μL. Glucose 147 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 757 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 2397 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 172 U/L, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels (7.65 mg/dL and 6.34 mg/dL, respectively). The abdominal ultrasound showed a normal-sized homogenous liver with no focal lesion or any sign of bile ducts dilation, the gall bladder’s wall also appeared normal in diameter with no sign of gallstone cholecystitis.

Hepatic encephalopathy due to acute hepatic failure was ruled out since the serum ammonia levels and prothrombin time internal normalized ratio (INR) were normal. We administered IV diazepam and phenytoin when status epilepticus was considered before the electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a very slow background indicative of a severe encephalopathy without epileptiform discharges. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormality. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated leukocytes of 12 cells/ μL (80% lymphocytes), erythrocytes of 120 cells/μL, protein levels of 19.8 mg/dl and normal glucose levels (66 mg/dL) which revealed viral encephalitis. We initiated IV acyclovir because of the suspicion of herpes. Serologic tests and polymerase chain reaction specific for herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein - Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis E virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus of the CSF were negative. The serum was only positive for anti HAV IgM.

Therefore, acyclovir was stopped and we concluded that the encephalitis was an extrahepatic manifestation of HAV. The patient was managed conservatively, and during the next 24 h the patient regained consciousness and improved significantly.

Over the next six months, the patient had been seizure-free with normal serological tests, ALT: 25 U/L, AST: 17 U/L, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels 0.5 and 0.1 mg/dL respectively, and EEG recordings","Diagnosis:

Hepatitis A-Induced Encephalitis

* Probability: High
* Emergency: High
* Rationale: The patients history of confirmed hepatitis A (HAV), the onset of neurological symptoms after HAV infection, absence of other infectious etiology, and improvement after supportive care strongly suggest an extrahepatic manifestation of HAV as the cause of encephalitis. The absence of other causes (e.g., normal serum ammonia levels, no nuchal rigidity, normal CT findings) further corroborates this diagnosis.

Suitable Treatments:
* Supportive Care: Monitoring vital signs, maintaining hydration, and nutritional support
* - Neurological Management: Antiepileptic drugs such as diazepam and phenytoin for seizure control
* - Observation and Monitoring: Regular follow-up with neurological examinations and liver function tests"
